Project title: Competition between native <i>Ostrea edulis</i> and invasive <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> oysters in the Adriatic Sea â€“ effects on the ecosystem, fisheries and aquaculture

<p align=" justify">Main objective of the project is to assess the <b>impact of the invasive oyster species</b> <i>C. gigas</i> on the ecosystem, fisheries and aquaculture, with focus on the <b>native commercially important oyster species</b> <i>O. edulis</i>.</p>

<p align=" justify">In the Adriatic Sea non-native invasive oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> started to spread and presents a threat to the native European flat oyster <i>Ostrea edulis</i>. Pacific oyster <i>C. gigas</i> was introduced by aquaculture to Mediterranean Sea in the 1960s as a response to the decrease of O. edulis production caused by high mortalities due to parasitic diseases. Introduction of <i>C. gigas</i> was limited to the aquaculture sites, but as environmental conditions in those areas were favourable this species started to reproduce and spread outside aquaculture sites. Although <i>C. gigas</i> is used for aquaculture all along the Europe, in the eastern Adriatic Sea it is not the case, and it is considered an invasive species.</p>

A lot of field and lab work were done during the project and based on collected dana papers about its distribution, abundance, reproduction and feeding ecology are published.
