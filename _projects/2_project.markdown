Project title: Competition between native <i>Ostrea edulis</i> and invasive <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> oysters in the Adriatic Sea â€“ effects on the ecosystem, fisheries and aquaculture

<p align=" justify">Main objective of the project is to assess the <b>impact of the invasive oyster species</b> <i>C. gigas</i> on the ecosystem, fisheries and aquaculture, with focus on the <b>native commercially important oyster species</b> <i>O. edulis</i>.</p>

<p align=" justify">In the Adriatic Sea non-native invasive oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> started to spread and presents a threat to the native European flat oyster <i>Ostrea edulis</i>. Pacific oyster <i>C. gigas</i> was introduced by aquaculture to Mediterranean Sea in the 1960s as a response to the decrease of O. edulis production caused by high mortalities due to parasitic diseases. Introduction of <i>C. gigas</i> was limited to the aquaculture sites, but as environmental conditions in those areas were favourable this species started to reproduce and spread outside aquaculture sites. Although <i>C. gigas</i> is used for aquaculture all along the Europe, in the eastern Adriatic Sea it is not the case, and it is considered an invasive species.</p>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
