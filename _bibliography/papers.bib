By settling on top of each other, they may create massive biogenic reefs.

The influence of environmental parameters on the reproduction of M. gigas was evaluated from January 2008 to October 2009 with oysters grown on a raft in the Ría de Arousa (Galicia, NW Spain). Temperature and chlorophyll a are directly correlated to sexual maturation. Oysters can mature at temperatures below 14°C. The temperature necessary for spawning differs between the sexes, requiring a temperature above 15°C for males and 18°C for females. Females had a single massive spawn between June and September, while males had partial spawning from May to December with two peaks, one in May–September and another in October–December, with the second peak more pronounced. The first spawning peak is related to high temperatures and concentrations of chlorophyll a, and the second spawning peak is mainly related to the food availability in the water. The spawning asynchrony may be impeding establishment of wild M. gigas populations in Spain.},

Successful employment of ecosystem engineers in coastal protection largely depends on long-term persistence of their structure, which is in turn dependent on the population dynamics of the individual species. Oysters, such as the Paciﬁc oyster (Crassostrea gigas), are recognized as ecosystem engineers with potential for use in coastal protection. Persistence of oyster reefs is strongly determined by recruitment and shell production (growth), processes facilitated by gregarious settlement on extant shell substrate. Although the Paciﬁc oyster has been introduced world-wide, and has formed dense reefs in the receiving coastal waters, the population biology of live oysters and the quantitative mechanisms maintaining these reefs has rarely been studied, hence the aim of the present work. This study had two objectives: (1) to describe the demographics of extant C. gigas reefs, and (2) to estimate vertical reef accretion rates and carbonate production in these oyster reefs. Three long-living oyster reefs ({\textgreater}30 years old), which have not been exploited since their ﬁrst occurrence, were examined in the Oosterschelde estuary in the Netherlands. A positive reef accretion rate (7.0e16.9 mm yearÀ1 shell material) was observed, consistent with selfmaintenance and persistent structure. We provide a framework to predict reef accretion and population persistence under varying recruitment, growth and mortality scenarios.},

Fishing institutes all around the word carry out regular surveys with the aim of monitoring the stocks of commercial species. These surveys comprise often more than one hundred of sampling stations and cover large geographical areas. Although superﬁcial sediment grain sizes are among the main drivers of benthic communities and provide crucial information for studies on coastal dynamics, overall there is a strong lack of this type of data, possibly, because traditional surface sediment sampling methods use grabs, that require considerable time and eﬀort to be carried out on regular basis or on large areas. In face of these aspects, we developed an easy and un-expensive method to sample superﬁcial sediments, during bivalve ﬁsheries monitoring surveys, without increasing survey time or human resources. The method was successfully evaluated and validated during a typical bivalve survey carried out on the Northwest coast of Portugal, conﬁrming that it had any interference with the survey objectives. Furthermore, the method was validated by collecting samples using a traditional Van Veen grabs (traditional method), which showed a similar grain size composition to the ones collected by the new method, on the same localities. We recommend that the procedure is implemented on regular bivalve ﬁshing surveys, together with an image analysis system to analyse the collected samples. The new method will provide substantial quantity of data on surface sediment in coastal areas, using a non-expensive and eﬃcient manner, with a high potential application in diﬀerent ﬁelds of research.},

	abstract = {The precarious status of ﬂat oyster Ostrea edulis stocks in Europe is widely acknowledged. To build a scientiﬁc basis for oyster restoration, an elevated experimental reef stocked with O. edulis was established within Poole Bay (Dorset, UK). Oysters were out planted on twenty four oyster reef modules (80 cm above sea bed) and compared with oysters held on the sea bed close to each reef module to test the hypothesis that a reef habitat enhanced physiological performance. Filtration and respiration rates, condition index, haemolymph protein concentration, haemocyte counts and gonad maturation were measured as indicators of physiological performance. During the ﬁrst 15 months of oyster reef deployment, water samples were collected at regular intervals at the sea bed and at a height of 80 cm from the sea bed to determine chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended solids and bacterial abundance. Total suspended solids were signiﬁcantly higher at the sea bed than at 80 cm above the sea bed at every sampling interval, while bacterial abundance adjacent to the sea bed was signiﬁcantly higher than 80 cm above the sea bed in August and November 2013 when temperature was 18 °C and 15 °C, respectively. The ﬁltration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of ‘reef oysters’ (oysters on elevated reefs) were signiﬁcantly higher than ‘sea bed oysters’ (oysters held on the sea bed). Respiration rates varied among months but were not signiﬁcantly affected by elevation (reef/sea bed). Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had signiﬁcantly higher numbers of haemocytes than sea bed oysters. As current stocks of European ﬂat oysters (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe.},

Dynamic Energy and Mass Budgets in Biological Systems. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 424 pp.) has been adapted to describe the dynamics of growth and reproduction of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared in different areas under conditions ranging from controlled to natural. The values of the model parameters were estimated from available physiological data and from published information. The sets of data used to validate the model came from three long-term growth experiments ({\textgreater} 5 months) performed on Pacific oysters reared under different conditions of food and environment. The forcing variables were temperature and phytoplankton densities, the latter being assessed from in vivo fluorescence and chlorophyll-a concentration measurement. The successful validation of the model on the three data sets demonstrated its ability to capture the dynamics of the energy budget in the Pacific oyster in various environments with the same set of parameters. The only parameter that varied between simulations was the half-saturation coefficient (XK), because of a different diet composition between the three environments under test. The model successfully reproduced quantitatively the growth and reproduction and the timing of spawning. These first simulation data led us to propose several promising perspectives of application for this model in shellfish ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (i.e., IMTA) is a practice combining organisms with different trophic levels with the ﬁnal purpose of transforming the continuous waste of food by targeting species into nutrient input for other non-target species. This practice very often involves ﬁlter feeders, such as bivalves, by the use of which bioenergetics budgets are strongly inﬂuenced by the quality and quantity of different foods. However, to date, scant information is available, to really understand the rebounds of food availability on the growth performances of these harvested biomasses in the natural environment. By choosing the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis as a model, this study aims to (1) characterize the functional response of the species to deﬁne all parameters related to food intake strategies and (2) to investigate how responses change as a function of varying food sources. Laboratory procedures have been designed to evaluate the clearance rates (CR) and assimilation efﬁciencies (AE) of M. galloprovincialis with varying food concentrations, while different diets (i.e., seagrass, phytoplankton, and pellets) have been provided to investigate how differently they reach saturation. Results show that in the presence of phytoplankton and seagrass as food sources, the feeding strategies of M. galloprovincialis follow a II-type Holling's curve, while it shows a I-type Holling's curve when pellet food is provided. Investigating the behavioural components of functional responses may improve our ability to predict where to place shellﬁsh cultures, as it may be useful in the context of IMTA management and in addressing siting studies.},

Adapted from Pheloung et al.’s Weed Risk Assessment (WRA), the “-ISK” toolkits were also “self-automated workbooks” in Excel® VisualBasic® architecture of the ’WRA. In creating AS-ISK, we incorporated the conceptual approach (questions and guidance) of the generic risk screening module of the European Non-native Species in Aquaculture Risk Analysis Scheme (ENSARS) into a single “turnkey application” that was based on the Excel® VisualBasic® architecture used by the WRA and its “-ISK” derivatives. Applicable to virtually all climatic zones and all aquatic plants and animals regardless of ecosystem (marine, fresh, brackish water), AS-ISK comprises 49 basic questions on the taxon’s biogeographical and historical traits and its biological and ecological interactions. In compliance with the “minimum requirements” for use with the new EU Regulation on invasive alien species of EU concern, AS-ISK includes a preamble of background information on the species as well as questions on its potential socio-economic impacts and those on ecosystem services, and an additional section (six questions) for the assessor to predict how forecasted changes in climate are likely to influence the risks of introduction, establishment, dispersal and impact of a species. Following a concise but detailed description of AS-ISK, an example assessment of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is provided, with the French northern coastline as the risk assessment area, to demonstrate use of this decision-support tool.

The DEB theory has been successfully applied to several bivalve species to compare bioenergetic and physiological strategies for the utilization of energy. In particular, mussels within the Mytilus edulis complex (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and M. trossulus) have been the focus of many studies due to their economic and ecological importance, and their worldwide distribution. However, DEB parameter values have never been estimated for Mytilus californianus, a species that is an ecological dominant on rocky intertidal shores on the west coast of North America and which likely varies considerably from mussels in the M. edulis complex in its physiology. We estimated a set of DEB parameters for M. californianus using the covariation method estimation procedure and compared these to parameter values from other bivalve species. Model parameters were used to compare sensitivity to environmental variability among species, as a ﬁrst examination of how strategies for physiologically contending with environmental change by M. californianus may differ from those of other bivalves. Results suggest that based on the parameter set obtained, M. californianus has favorable energetic strategies enabling it to contend with a range of environmental conditions. For instance, the allocation fraction of reserve to soma (κ) is among the highest of any bivalves, which is consistent with the observation that this species can survive over a wide range of environmental conditions, including prolonged periods of starvation.},

	abstract = {To assess the potential for rearing in smooth scallops (Flexopecten glaber) from the North Western Adriatic Sea, various biological traits were studied in both ﬁshed and reared individuals. Condition and gonadosomatic indices, gonadic cycle, biochemical components and histopathological conditions were investigated in adults from commercial ﬁshing. Throughout two consecutive years, juvenile scallops were collected by means of artiﬁcial collectors and maintained in an experimental rearing facility. Growth, onset of sexual maturity, size/age at ﬁrst maturity were investigated in reared individuals. In ﬁshed scallops, spawning and resting periods occurred mostly between July and September and from October to December, respectively. Gonadosomatic index and condition index increased from January to June and decreased from July to October; these main variations corresponded to gametogenesis and spawning, respectively. In both somatic and gonadic tissues, proteins were the major biochemical component (about 80\%), with no evident seasonal variation. In somatic tissues, total carbohydrates were always higher than lipids; in gonads, lipids exceeded total carbohydrates for most of the year, peaking at maximum values when only mature or spawning animals were found. Observation and quantiﬁcation of abnormal features of gonadic tissues, like oocyte atresia, haemocytic inﬁltration, neoplasia, and presence of parasites, suggest the overall good health conditions of scallops in the study area, no serious threat due to diseases being evident. In reared scallops, sexual maturity was attained within the ﬁrst year, thus indicating F. glaber as a fairly early maturation species compared with other scallop species. The ﬁrst maturity event occurred in about 330 days from the immersion of the collectors, at mean shell height values ranging from 22.4 to 25.1 mm, well below the minimum landing size (40 mm) established by the EU for queen scallop ﬁshery in Atlantic waters. Appreciable growth rates and a relatively short grow-out period, precociousness in maturation, high availability of wild spat, easily and inexpensively collected, absence of diseases and other mortality factors are promising elements to introduce the cultivation of F. glaber in the North Western Adriatic coastal waters.},

Histological preparations of gonads showed that gametogenesis started when temperature was at its lowest in winter. The water temperature in San Cibran never fell low enough to interrupt it. Gametogenesis proceeded slowly and spawning took place in M a y June, although the predicted time of ripening was early March. Salinity in San Cibran was relatively stable throughout the year; it did not seem to have any influence on gametogenesis. Available food appeared to be a very important factor in controlling gonad growth, once gametogenesis was initiated. The major concentration of suspended organic particulate matter was present in the spring at the time of rapid gonadal maturation. Only one spawning period was observed. Larvae were released when the food in the water was high. Seasonal changes in the main biochemical components of this oyster were determined for a standard individual. Lipids and carbohydrates presented a similar time-course whereas proteins were constant. When food was abundant, energy reserves were built up. Spawning produced a decrease in biochemical constituent levels, and recovery coincided with the phytoplankton bloom. The stored reserves, mainly lipids, were used to overcome a state of energy imbalance in late autumn associated with low food availability. Results show this oyster to be an opportunist organism which concentrates its reproductive effort during a short period of favourable conditions and which is directly dependent on nutritive availability in the environment.},

The species has, since established in the ﬁeld, covered all available hard substrata in the bay and gradually expanded south along the coast of the neighboring province of Rı´ o Negro, 90 km away from its original introduction site. Our work focused on the reproductive dynamics of the species at the introduction site, with emphasis on the thermal thresholds needed for each stage of gonad development. During early spring, the oysters in Anegada Bay go through active gonad proliferation. Maturity extends mainly from October to January. The ﬁrst spawning occurs in November, when seawater temperature exceeds 17°C, and peaks from December to February, when seawater temperature lies in the range ot 19–21.5°C. The timing of gonad development is size dependent. Larger (\$70 mm) and medium-size oysters begin spawning ﬁrst, whereas small oysters ({\textless}40 mm) represent the late spawners of the season. The C. gigas population in Anegada Bay is a clear and well-documented case of an introduction site where optimal environmental conditions are met, both for complete gonad maturation and for successful larval survival and settlement. We compiled a series of C. gigas cases from different parts of the world in which reproduction is related to seawater temperature. We concluded that the thermal threshold for full female gonad ripening in this species is strict (temperature {\textgreater} 17°C), and spawning only occurs in those sites where this threshold is reached.},

	abstract = {The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was introduced in Europe for commercial purposes in the mid 1960s. It was initially thought that low winter temperatures would restrain this species' reproduction and settlement; however, its present distribution in areas where no introduction has taken place suggests that natural invasion and expansion has occurred. Along the European coast, wild populations of Pacific oysters are already found from northern Germany to southern Portugal. Whether C. gigas will continue to further expand through northern waters will depend on its physiological performance. In this study, the performance of wild oyster populations has been studied in terms of growth and reproduction at three stations: La Rochelle (France; 46°N), Yerseke (Oosterschelde estuary, The Netherlands, 51°N), and Texel (Wadden Sea estuary, The Netherlands, 53°N). The French population had the lowest somatic-shell mass ratio and an increase in maximum shell length, somatic and gonadal mass was observed from France to the Netherlands. In addition, mean oocyte diameter decreased significantly from south to north. The combination of increasing gonadal mass and decreasing oocyte volume suggests an increasing reproductive output in terms of egg numbers from France to The Netherlands. Differences in temperature between locations will at least be partly responsible for the observed patterns; however, other environmental factors (such as food availability, predation pressure, sediment type and/or seston concentration) cannot be excluded. Since smaller eggs (oocytes) are thought to have a longer development time, the environmental conditions along the Dutch coast may result in increased larval dispersal and possibly in further population expansion.},

	abstract = {Invasions of non-indigenous species into coastal habitats have been a frequent phenomenon in the last decades, sometimes with significant impact on the receiving ecosystem. However, the understanding of the entire process and especially the relative importance of larval supply and local recruitment remains unclear. In this study, we simulate the invasion of a benthic invertebrate into a previously uncolonised habitat over several years and validate the results with field data. Therefore, we present field data from a monitoring programme revealing the rapid invasion of the oyster Crassostrea gigas into the East Frisian Wadden Sea, North Sea, between 2003 and 2005. The applied model combines a simple, spatially-explicit population dynamics model for the adult stage with a particle tracking model for the larval stage of the life cycle. Simulation results are able to reproduce the large-scale pattern of the field data and indicate a domination of larval supply on the population dynamics in the early stage of the invasion. Though monitoring and simulations suggest a single larval source outside the study area in the west, the population dynamics in the eastern part is only explainable with an additional source within the study area attributed to an unintentional input of juveniles by mussel fishery. High sensitivities to uncertain parameters result in distinct deviations between monitoring and simulations at particular sites. Especially the impact of site-specific variations of the post-settlement mortality underlines the variability of local recruitment conditions and indicates the need for spatially resolved information for exact predictions.},

In order to assess their environmental and economic costs, we applied the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS) and performed a comparison with other taxa of invaders in Europe. Impacts were scored into six environmental and six socioeconomic categories, with each category containing five impact levels. Among 49 aquatic macroinvertebrates, the most impacting species were the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis (Milne-Edwards, 1853) and the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771). The highest impacts found per GISS impact category were, separately; on ecosystems, through predation, as competitors, and on animal production. Eleven species have an impact score {\textgreater} 10 (high impact) and seven reach impact level 5 in at least one impact category (EU blacklist candidates), the maximum score that can be given is 60 impact points. Comparisons were drawn between aquatic macroinvertebrates and vertebrate invaders such as fish, mammals and birds, as well as terrestrial arthropods, revealing invasive freshwater macroinvertebrates to be voracious predators of native prey and damaging to native ecosystems compared with other taxa. GISS can be used to compare these taxa and will aid policy making and targeting of invasive species for management by relevant agencies, or to assist in producing species blacklist candidates.},

	abstract = {Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg 1793) have been introduced into the Wadden Sea (North Sea), where they settle on native mussel beds (Mytilus edulis L.), which represent the only extensive insular hard substrata in this soft-sediment environment. As abundances of C. gigas rose, some mussel beds became increasingly overgrown with oysters, whereas others did not. Field experiments revealed that recruitment of C. gigas was higher in the lower intertidal than in the upper subtidal zone, that it was higher on conspecifics than on mussels, and that it was not affected by barnacle epigrowth except when settling on mussels. Mussel recruitment is known from inter- and subtidal zones. It occurred equally on oyster and mussel shells but showed a clear preference for barnacle epigrowth over clean shells. Assuming that settlement and recruitment are key processes for species abundances on the North Sea coast, it is predicted that the positive feedback in oyster settlement will lead to rapid reef formation of this invader at the expense of mussel beds. Mussels, however, may escape competitive exclusion by settling between or on the larger oysters especially when barnacles are abundant. Experimental patches with mussels were more often covered by fucoid algae (Fucus vesiculosus forma mytili Nienburg) than patches with oysters, and oyster recruitment was poor underneath such algal canopies. Thus, fucoids may provide the native mussels with a refuge from the invading oysters and the two bivalves may coexist, provided food is not limiting.},

	abstract = {Among the increasing number of species introduced to coastal regions by man, only a few are able to establish themselves and spread in their new environments. We will show that the Paciﬁc oyster (Crassostrea gigas) took 17 years before a large population of several million oysters became established on natural mussel beds in the vicinity of an oyster farm near the island of Sylt (northern Wadden Sea, eastern North Sea). The ﬁrst oyster, which had dispersed as a larva and settled on a mussel bed, was discovered 5 years after oyster farming had commenced. Data on abundance and size-frequency distribution of oysters on intertidal mussel beds around the island indicate that recruitment was patchy and occurred only in 6 out of 18 years. Signiﬁcant proportions of these cohorts survived for at least 5 years. The population slowly expanded its range from intertidal to subtidal locations as well as from Sylt north- and southwards along the coastline. Abundances of more than 300 oysters mÀ2 on mussel beds were observed in 2003, only after two consecutive spatfalls in 2001 and 2002. Analyses of mean monthly water temperatures indicate that recruitment coincided with above-average temperatures in July and August when spawning and planktonic dispersal occurs. We conclude that the further invasion of C. gigas in the northern Wadden Sea will depend on high late-summer water temperatures.},

	abstract = {Eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica and hard clams Mercenaria mercenaria are key organisms for both the ecosystem services they provide and for their commercial value, but their populations have declined greatly worldwide. In an attempt to understand the interaction between bivalve physiology and environmental conditions, filter-feeding assays were carried out in a shallow estuary, the Indian River Lagoon (IRL; Florida, USA). The feeding behavior of the bivalves was studied using in situ filter-feeding devices and the biodeposition method in the 3 basins of the IRL during March and August 2015. Water characteristics (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chl a, and total, organic, and inorganic particulates) were related to possible changes in the feeding physiology of the bivalves. Oysters had higher clearance rates, filtration rates, and rejection than clams. The high rejection of inorganic matter allowed oysters to increase the organic matter ingested, leading to high absorption efficiencies. In contrast, because clam rejection was low regardless of elevated levels of inorganic matter, their absorption efficiency only increased with higher organic matter content. Both species preferred higher salinities, and the amount of organic matter in the water had a negative relationship with some feeding parameters (filtration rate for both species, and rejection for oysters). Acute environmental change brought about by a brown tide (caused by the alga Aureoumbra lagunensis) also affected these 2 bivalve species differently, supporting the hypothesis that oysters and clams have different physiological capabilities that drive their ability to survive in dynamic estuarine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {At an approximately 12 000 m2 sheltered intertidal bivalve bed in the western part of the Limfjord, Denmark, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas co-occurs with the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The relative significance of the impact of the 2 species on phytoplankton density during a tidal cycle was estimated by combining field measurements of clearance rates and modelling of the bivalve bed (topography, biomass distribution, temporal and spatial water coverage and depth). The average density of C. gigas and M. edulis was 35 ± 36 and 1001 ± 685 ind. m−2, respectively. The water volume cleared during a tidal cycle was estimated at 45 838 m3, of which C. gigas and M. edulis contributed 9169 and 36 669 m3, respectively. Therefore, M. edulis contributed 4 times as much as C. gigas to the bivalve bed’s clearance, and the 2 bivalves were estimated to clear the water volume 1.9 times during each tidal cycle. However, the estimated water column cleared during low tide is overestimated due to phytoplankton depletion. Hence, it is concluded that the bivalve bed clears the water close to 1 time each tidal cycle. This, together with a low dry weight of soft parts, indicates that the bivalve bed, in general, is food-limited.},

	abstract = {The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of water current velocities on the clearance rate of Mytilus edulis when different numbers of mussels were used in the experiments. An automatic setup, which controlled and monitored the algal concentration continually, was used to measure the effect of increasing current velocity (0.05–1.4 m/sec) on the M. edulis clearance rate. Clearance rate measurements were performed under constant food concentrations of 3,000 cells/mL of Rhodomonas salina on either 3 mussels or 20 mussels. We found that the clearance rate of 20 mussels was unaffected by current velocities up to 1.4 m/sec, whereas experiments with 3 mussels showed that clearance of the mussels decreased progressively at current velocities greater than 0.2 m/sec, and reached 0 L/h per individual at current velocities greater than 0.6 m/sec. The constant feeding at all current velocities observed in the experiments with 20 mussels was most likely a result of a combination of reduced current velocity within the aggregated mussels, a current velocity-dependent change of siphon orientation, and attachment of the mussels at current velocities less than 1.2 m/sec, whereas in experiments with 3 mussels, mussels were detached at \$0.4 m/sec and the mussel valves were closed in general. Thus, it is evident that the number of mussels present in the experimental tank affects the results and emphasizes the importance of discriminating between the individual level and the level of mussel aggregations in the study of current velocity effects on clearance, especially when the study is made on a bivalve species that form dense beds in nature, to ensure consistency with ﬁeld observations.},

	abstract = {The sub-tropical mussel Mytella charruana has been reported as invasive along the southeast coast of the USA since 1986. This mussel has been found to negatively impact the keystone species in its invaded range, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To date, however, no mechanism for this negative impact has been determined. To elucidate the role of the invasive mussel on economically important oyster reefs, we compared the feeding of both species in a lagoon along the east coast of Florida (USA). Three different methodologies were used: (1) in situ filter-feeding experiments using the biodeposition method to estimate feeding behavior; (2) laboratory assays to estimate the depletion of bacterial particles using a flow cytometer; and (3) stable isotope analysis in conjunction with ellipse-based metrics to investigate the niche size and overlap of these 2 species. The in situ filter-feeding experiments revealed that, compared to C. virginica, M. charruana had significantly higher clearance, filtration, rejection, organic ingestion, and absorption rates, as well as higher rejection percentage and absorption efficiency, but rejected the same amount of inorganic particles. Flow cytometry data suggested that bacteria were a food source for both bivalve species. Stable isotope values confirmed that M. charruana and C. virginica filled similar functional niches in this ecosystem. These results suggest that M. charruana can out-compete native oysters; the findings also demonstrate that an invasion of M. charruana might significantly alter plankton abundance, potentially limiting food sources available to other less efficient native filter-feeders such as clams.},

The greatest growth rates were observed in mussels growing at average salinities of 25.7 and 29.5, the lowest rates occurred at the location exhibiting the most ﬂuctuating salinity regime over time, with an average 20.5. Individuals in waters with a salinity of 25.7 also displayed the greatest condition index of all locations (12.1 mg/cm3, P {\textless} 0.05). Mussels from ﬁve of six locations displayed similar oxygen consumption rates (P \# 0.83) when standardized to weight (range, 0.78–0.88 mg O2/g/h. Of the salinities noted in the experiment, 25.7 appears to be the optimal salinity in terms of growth and condition, whereas strongly ﬂuctuating salinity obviously involves reduced growth. At ﬁrst glance, this study may appear to be just one among numerous attempts to describe the effect of salinity on growth and respiration in Mytilus edulis and its Baltic hybrids. However, the majority of studies focus on ﬁeld transplants and responses to salinity alterations in the laboratory, whereas only sparse information exists on locally adapted blue mussels in relation to their ambient, native salinity.},

Rejection of filtered material as pseudofaeces prior to ingestion remained a constant fraction of about 0.93X the mass of filtered material, so that ingestion rate showed no signs of stabilising at even the highest food availabihties. We confirm that M. edulis may preferentially reject inorganic matter with pseudofaeces. More significant was the novel observation that the net selection efficiency with which filtered organics were selectively retained for ingestion increased rapidly with the rate at whlch seston was filtered, this lncrease being faster for seston of higher organic content. The result was that the organic content of Ingested matter was enriched by up to 5 times the organic content of filtered particles. Further, net absorption efficiency for ingested organics varied in strong positive relation with the organic content of ingested material. Therefore, rates of organic absorption increased with seston filtration rate, and net energy balance increased despite the decreasing organic content of particles available at higher concentrations. These collective findings demonstrate continuous interrelated changes in feeding physiology that help to maintain rates of nutrient acquisition independent of short-term fluctuations in seston composition.},

Little is known, however, about how competitive interactions within and between species may influence how species respond to multiple stressors. We experimentally assessed separate and combined effects of temperature (12 or 16°C) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (400 and 1000 ppm) on the health and biological functioning of native (Ostrea edulis) and invasive (Crassostrea gigas) oysters held alone and in intraspecific or interspecific mixtures. We found evidence of reduced phagocytosis under elevated CO2 and, when combined with increased temperature, a reduction in the number of circulating haemocytes. Generally, C. gigas showed lower respiration rates relative to O. edulis when the species were in intraspecific or interspecific mixtures. In contrast, O. edulis showed a higher respiration rate relative to C. gigas when held in an interspecific mixture and exhibited lower clearance rates when held in intraspecific or interspecific mixtures. Overall, clearance rates of C. gigas were consistently greater than those of O. edulis. Collectively, our findings indicate that a species’ ability to adapt metabolic processes to environmental conditions can be modified by biotic context and may make some species (here, C. gigas) competitively superior and less vulnerable to future climatic scenarios at local scales. If these conclusions are generic, the relative role of species interactions, and other biotic parameters, in altering the outcomes of climate change will require much greater research emphasis.},

The results showed that the characteristics of available suspended matter for mussels in terms of particle concentration (TPM: mg/l) and organic content (f deﬁned as POM/TPM) ranged 1.03–2.30 mg/l, and 0.48 to 0.73 respectively throughout the study period. This indicates a rather stable feeding environment of low concentrations of high organic content particles despite the wide range of temperatures recorded (from 10 to 26 °C). However, a characteristic of such a variation pattern of particle suspension (TPM and f) was that shortterm variations (in the course of days) covered the whole range of annual variation. Accordingly, physiological parameters characterizing both food acquisition and absorption in mussels were found to respond to shortterm variations in food regime. Pseudofeces production in mussels was low (less than 5\% in most cases) and they tended to reduce their clearance rate instead of increasing their pseudofeces production in response to rising particle concentration. The absorption efﬁciency was positively related to the organic content of the seston particles. There was also a positive correlation between clearance rate and absorption efﬁciency. The reduction of clearance, ingestion and absorption rates obtained in July highlights a negative inﬂuence of high water temperatures upon feeding and digestive processes of mussels.},

	abstract = {We compared growth simulations by dynamic energy budget (DEB) and scope for growth (SFG) models of the Paciﬁc oyster Crassostrea gigas, cultivated in Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. This bay is located at a latitude in the middle of the European range of the species, and is characterized by high concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and a marked gradient between high-turbidity sites in the north (daily SPM N 500 mg L− 1) and intermediate-turbidity sites in the south. The models use two forcing variables: seawater temperature and food density. We tested two indices of food availability: chlorophyll a and microalgal concentrations. In the SFG model, food intake is simulated by a type-II Holling functional response, as in the DEB formulation, and the effect of turbidity in both models is therefore taken into account principally through the half-saturation coefﬁcient for this functional response. Chlorophyll a concentrations were three to four times higher at the high-turbidity site, but oyster growth rates were signiﬁcantly lower at this site than at the intermediate-turbidity site. A comparison of observed and simulated values showed that the DEB model performed better than the SFG model if microalgal concentration was used as an index of food availability, with the SFG model underestimating oyster growth in summer and autumn. However, the SFG model was much more efﬁcient if chlorophyll a concentrations were used, with the DEB model systematically overestimating summer and autumn growth. This comparison suggests that both SFG and DEB simulations could be improved, to give a more accurate description of oyster growth in a turbid environment, and that the pre-ingestive selection mechanisms used by suspension feeders in turbid environments should probably be included in the formulation of feeding processes.},

The model was amended in two ways: a new set of parameters was incorporated and a full description of gonad construction in spring was added, with a new state variable. The application of this model to a dataset for oyster growth measured in four bays over two years showed that this model better described reproductive effort, without modifying overall growth dynamics. We then explored the reproductive responses of oysters to their environment in greater detail, by applying this new version of the model with the theoretical forcing variables of phytoplankton concentration and temperature. Spawning time was found to be driving principally by yearly mean temperature, and reproductive effort was found to depend mostly on the halfsaturation coefﬁcient of the functional response. These results highlight the importance of the half-saturation coefﬁcient and provide additional support for ﬁeld research on the food preferences of oysters.},

Seasonality in histology of storage tissues and glycogen storage capacity in isolated vesicular cells were also studied. Proteins, the main muscle components did not contribute to the gametogenetic effort. Glycogen and lipids were stored in the digestive gland, gonad and surrounding mantle area during the wintering period and the gonad and surrounding mantle area represented the main storage compartment supplying the reproductive effort. Gametogenesis in spring and summer was associated with an increase in lipid and protein contents and took place at the expense of glycogen reserves. Histological study of storage tissue in the gonad led us to deﬁne four seasonal stages of storage tissue development. In vitro, glycogen storage capacity in isolated vesicular cells was high from November to March and markedly reduced during gametogenesis, decreasing below detectable levels after spawning.

Application of a dynamic energy budget model to the Paciﬁc oyster, C. gigas, reared under various environmental conditions. J. Sea Res. 56, 156–167.] successfully applied this model to oysters reared in three environments with no tide and low turbidity, using chlorophyll a concentration as food quantiﬁer. However, the robustness of the oyster-DEB model needs to be validated in varying environments where different food quantiﬁers reﬂect the food available for oysters, as is the case in estuaries and most coastal ecosystems. We therefore tested the oysterDEB model on C. gigas reared in an Atlantic coastal pond from January 2006 to January 2007. The model relies on two forcing variables: seawater temperature and food density monitored through various food quantiﬁers. Based on the high temperature range measured in this oyster pond (3–30 °C), new boundary values of the temperature tolerance range were estimated both for ingestion and respiration rates. Several food quantiﬁers were then tested to select the most suitable for explaining the observed growth and reproduction of C. gigas reared in an oyster pond. These were: particulate organic matter and carbon, chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton enumeration (expressed in cell number per litre or in cumulative cell biovolume). We conclude that when phytoplankton enumeration was used as food quantiﬁer, the new version of oyster-DEB model presented here reproduced the growth and reproduction of C. gigas very accurately. The next step will be to validate the model under contrasting coastal environmental conditions so as to conﬁrm the accuracy of phytoplankton enumeration as a way of representing the available food that sustains oyster growth.},

The water temperature was 2–3 °C higher at the surface than at the bottom from early spring to midsummer. The chlorophyll a level was also higher at the surface during March and April, when a spring phytoplankton bloom occurred in the bay. The seasonal variation in the proximate composition of oyster tissues differed between the surface and the bottom as well. Carbohydrate levels in oysters at the surface were somewhat higher in fall and winter, when the oysters were actively accumulating carbohydrates in their tissues for future growth and reproduction. Oysters at the surface tended to produce more eggs during the spring to early summer spawning period; the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly higher in surface oysters than in bottom oysters (p {\textless} 0.05). The overall growth and reproduction rates of the surface oysters were higher, even though the bottom oysters were located only 1–3 m below them.

The highest condition index values were recorded during the prespawning season at temperatures between 11-12°C. Condition index values gradually decreased from 14°C, coinciding with the appearance of the first larvae in the plankton. Condition index values were lowest in summer. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the condition indices were correlated mainly with temperature and to a lesser extent, with dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a and suspended matter. Absolute chlorophyll concentrations were low and presented a negative correlation with the condition index values, though this correlation was less pronounced than that of temperature. Gametogenesis was continuous all year round, but spawning took place only at temperatures of 14°C or higher, and larvae were present in the plankton to 28°C.

In general, spawnings occurred most of the year without prolonged periods of reproductive inactivity. Studies of this population throughout warm and cold oceanographic phenomena such as the El Nin˜o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 1997–1998 and the La Nin˜a event of 1998–2000 showed that the reproduction of this population occurred mainly between September and April, declining in the winter months from June through August, during which a period of sexual quiescence was observed in some individuals. An intense reproductive activity in the population, following the 1997–1998 warmer period, extended over the whole year. Histological analysis of the female portion of the gonad confirmed the GSI results and demonstrated the presence both of acini which appeared to be mature and other acini with various degrees of atresia and/or oocyte lysis. The study also revealed spawning asynchrony in this species and the presence of various stages of maturity within the same individual. Periods of high reproductive activity were correlated with strong diurnal temperature fluctuations and rises in phaeopigment concentration and phytoplankton cell counts, suggesting that these factors could be triggers for Argopecten spawning. These new insights on the reproductive cycle and conditioning of A. purpuratus would facilitate future management practices on the timing of artificial collectors and spat collection.},

	abstract = {Cerastoderma edule and Mya arenaria are two common bivalve species in European waters. Longevity and maximum size are much greater in the latter species. Because comparison of species life-history strategies states that a long life span (i.e. high annual survival) generally goes with lower fecundity, we hypothesise that reproductive output would be lower in M. arenaria than in C. edule. In the present paper, we studied the reproductive strategies of these two species in an intertidal and a subtidal area of the western Dutch Wadden Sea, by following seasonal changes in absolute and relative weights of somatic and gonadal tissues in these bivalves. Starting of spawning was similar in the two species, around May, except for intertidal M. arenaria, which initiated spawning in August. Individual energy investment in reproduction was similar for the two species but, unlike M. arenaria, C. edule spawned completely, releasing all energy of gonadal mass in the form of gametes. Mya arenaria used the gonad not only for reproduction but also for storage. In the intertidal area, we found a trade-off between longevity and reproduction, i.e. maximum reproductive output (expressed as a proportion of body mass) was higher in C. edule than in M. arenaria. However, since body size is larger and life span longer in M. arenaria than in C. edule, mean lifetime reproductive output per individual must be higher in the ﬁrst than in the latter. Based on the differences in reproductive strategies of these two species, we hypothesise that the negative effects of warming climate on bivalve population dynamics in the Wadden Sea will be stronger in C. edule than in M. arenaria.},

Concerning the effect of different temperatures during conditioning, the first mature oocytes were detected (absolute days) by the 27th day at 16 jC, 23rd day at 19 jC, 19th day at 22 jC and 22nd day at 25 jC. This information was applied to fit a logistic model to predict oocyte growth using temperature and time as main affecting parameters; D = Dmax/(1 + aeÀ kt) with D—oocyte diameter at time t (Am), Dmax—the asymptotic oocyte diameter (Am), a—adjustment parameter, k—slope of the curve during growing stage and t—time (days). The model fit consistently with values achieved at 16, 19 and 22 jC. The results obtained during this study could be used to improve conditioning procedures for C. gigas.},

Previous studies have shown that massive die-o¡s result from multi-factor processes related to reproduction of the species. We studied the reproductive cycle and the condition index of cultured oysters in the coastal lagoon of El Soldado, Sonora, as well as the relationship of the life cycle with environmental parameters.We used oocyte diameter to determine reproductive stages and the condition index to describe the physiological state of oysters. Additionally, the temperature, salinity, seston and chlorophyll a were recorded at the study site. The results showed that C. gigas began accelerated reproductive activity in March under the in£uence of high temperature and increased concentrations of food. No spawning events were recorded and gametes were reabsorbed within the gonad in September and October. The results showed a period of nutrient storage during autumn{\textasciicircum}winter and another period of gamete production in spring{\textasciicircum}summer. A mortality event occurred at the end of winter, tied to signi¢cant increases in temperature and availability of food and in accelerated reproductive activity and high condition index. These conditions were very similar to those reported in other countries during summer die-o¡s of C. gigas.},

	abstract = {Though many studies have been carried out on mortality events in Crassostrea gigas this is the ﬁrst study of the phenomenon in the Irish Sea. Unexplained summer mortalities have been taking place in C. gigas populations in Ireland since the 1990's. Production of this species currently occurs at low levels in Wales, with no reports of unusual mortalities and, as similar environmental factors and husbandry techniques exist in both countries, a comprehensive investigation into mortalities in Ireland was considered to be beneﬁcial to the industry in that country but applicable to growers in Wales also. A single cohort of C. gigas was obtained from a hatchery in both 2003 and 2004, and performance was compared over the summer months of both years following relaying at sites in Ireland and Wales. Oyster growth, condition, biochemical content and gonad development were examined and the inﬂuence of these parameters on summer mortality was investigated. Oysters were sampled every second week. Signiﬁcant mortalities occurred at the Irish sites during the study but not at the Welsh sites. Oysters at the Irish sites displayed signiﬁcantly increased growth, condition and gonad development compared to oysters at the Welsh sites. Both protein and glycogen levels were higher in the oysters held at the Irish sites than in the Welsh sites. Differences in the measured parameters between the two sites were greater in 2003, when temperatures were higher, than in 2004. Fast growth rates, gonadal development and spawning may contribute to increased physiological stress in young oysters making them more susceptible to mortalities during the summer months. This study indicated that site-related differences, such as environmental parameters, have a signiﬁcant effect on subsequent performance of oysters and, may strongly inﬂuence mortality rates.},

In both species the rate of gonadal development was directly related to the increase in temperature. At 14ºC the reproductive behaviour was similar, both species needing over 2 months to mature. At 18ºC, the rate of gonadal development of R. philippinarum was greater than that of R. decussatus. Nevertheless, the results of this study confirm that both species have adapted perfectly to the temperature conditions of the Galician Rias, though certain differences between the reproductive behaviour of these species were detected. R. philippinarum accumulates oocytes prior to their partial or total emission, while in the case of R. decussatus gametes are liberated continuously. In the early phases of its development, the gonad of R. philippinarum is highly heterogeneous in nature, with up to 3 reproductive states being present at the same time, while in R. decussatus gonadal development is much more uniform. Another major difference concerns the phenomenon of reabsorption, common in R. philippinarum but very rare in R. decussatus. These characteristics may well result in a greater reproductive activity in R. philippinarum than in R. decussatus, and a longer reproduction period in the former. They may also represent a certain advantage for the adaptation of the foreign species (R. philippinarum) over the native species (R. decussatus) to the temperature conditions of the Galician Rias.},

Results: The sexual cycle of the species was described through the histological examination of the gonads, the estimation of oocytes diameter, and the assessment of its condition and gonadal condition indices. The applied techniques gave similar results. The gametogenic cycle of C. gigas was precocious and more intense in oysters farmed within the lagoon than in the marine area, considering as well gonadal growth, maturation stages and gametes release.
Conclusions: The obtained results are probably related with the different environmental conditions of the studied habitats, temperature and food supply, in particular. The sexual cycle of the species was successfully completed in the marine area, stressing the invasive character of C. gigas.},

Separate analyses were made of gonad-visceral mass. The gametogenic cycle comprised tow phases: gametogenesis including ripeness and spawning (March–September) and sexual repose during the rest of the year. The C. gigas in the Bizert lagoon showed a clear cycle of energy storage and utilization. Total biochemical composition was about 6.50\% ± 3.01 of dry weight in glycogen, 14.34\% ± 3.60 of dry weight in protein and 6.67\% ± 1.34 of dry weight in lipids. Lipid and glycogen concentrations in the gonad-visceral mass were inversely related: maximum concentrations of glycogen occurred between December and February and corresponded with minimum concentrations of lipids. High glycogen contents recorded in winter supported the processes of gamatogenesis and then decreased progressively to attain low values at maturity and during summer corresponded to the first emission of gametes (June) and the beginning of total spawning, however lipids are accumulated in gonads during the period of maximum ripeness (spring) and decrease in summer. During autumn, the increase of total fatty acids values appeared to be related to the available food in association with an increase in the chlorophyll a concentrations. Protein contents show many variations throughout the year. High protein levels occurred in May and in July which corresponded to oocyte maturation and then decreased in late summer (beginning of total spawning). At the expense of the available food in autumn, protein concentrations increase again to assure recovery of the tissue weight of the bivalve, which induced an increase in the condition indices values.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of the voluntarily-introduced cupped oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has attained the proportions of species invasion in many intertidal habitats in Europe, presumably resulting from successful reproduction of farmed individuals. It is thus imperative to better understand the reproductive characteristics of farmed oysters, since they are directly under human control. We quantiﬁed the dry tissue mass (DTM), gametosomatic index (GSI), and reproductive cycle of farmed oysters at two sites in Bourgneuf Bay, France, in relation to environmental parameters using continuously-recording probes in 2005 and 2006. The GSI was developed for this study, based on the actual area occupied by gametes, rather than the area of the gonad previously used for quantitative histological estimation of reproductive eﬀort. The two sites, intermediate – (IT) and high-turbidity (HT), diﬀered markedly in the amount and quality of particulate suspended matter, and also in ﬁne-scale temperature variations. Oysters at both sites presented two spawning periods in both 2005 and 2006; Bourgneuf Bay is thus near the northernmost European limit for a 2spawning cycle in Crassostrea gigas. Gonad maturation was initiated when spring water temperature reached 8–10 ◦C, and gamete atresia occurred when water temperatures transiently dipped to 15–18 ◦C. Spawns, which occurred above 18 ◦C, were timed by ﬁne-scale water temperature variations. Particulate organic matter quality peaks, coinciding with gonad maturation, were related to DTM variations before spawning periods, for the IT oysters in both years, and for the HT oysters in 2006. The reproductive eﬀort (GSI) of oysters was similar at both sites; however, the fates of the gametes diﬀered according to site. At the ﬁrst spawning, the IT oyster gamete emissions were +1 month delayed, as were peak water temperatures greater than 18 ◦C, and more pronounced, compared to the HT site. Although the second spawning showed high proportions of atretic oocytes at both sites in both years, the IT oysters evacuated twice as many gametes as the HT oysters in 2005. The IT conditions therefore appear more suited to Crassostrea gigas gamete evacuation than the HT conditions.},

A progressive warming trend was observed, especially since 1995, when oyster proliferation ﬁrst became severe. Threshold temperatures for oocyte growth, larval development and settlement were achieved in both 2005 and 2006. The HT site showed greater numbers of larvae and post-larvae than the IT site for both years, with the highest numbers of post-larvae observed at both sites during the warmer summer of 2006.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the reproductive pattern were performed using biometric measurement approach, sex ratio determination, histology and a gonad filling index. Each experimental treatment led to different strategies for growth and resource allocation. The gametogenic cycle, appeared entirely modulated, accelerated or delayed, by coupled temperature/photoperiod parameters. Temperature played a key role in gonial mitosis regulation. Gonia proliferation was set off and sustained by winter temperature (8–11 8C) whatever the physiological state of oysters. Maturation of germ cells appeared to be a function of temperature and could proceed at low temperature, while ripe oysters were obtained at 8 8C in winter conditioning. The three conditioning methods used in this study, allowed the production of gametes throughout the year, including in the autumnal resting period. Moreover, stocks of ripe oysters could be maintained at low temperature during several months to produce spat when desired for aquaculture production.},

	abstract = {In macrotidal coastal ecosystems, spatial heterogeneity of the water column properties is induced by both oceanic and continental influences. Hydrodynamic processes generate a land-sea gradient of environmental conditions, affecting the biological performances of sedentary organisms. The aim of the present study is to establish an extensive spatial assessment in the reproductive investment of the wild Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Arcachon Bay. This is done by looking for a relationship between the Lawrence and Scott condition index (LSCI) and two tidal processes: the immersion level (IL) and the local oceanic flushing time (LoFt). The LSCI of C. gigas was assessed, just before gamete release, at 68 sampling stations in Arcachon Bay. Oyster performance was overall low and spatially variable. Significant differences in the LSCI were detected between the outer and inner bay. Oyster reefs located toward the mouth of the bay exhibited high LSCI (between 9 and 11), while oyster reefs located in inner bay, especially in south-eastern part around the Eyre River, had low LSCI (below 6). Linear modelling allowed to highlight significant effects of both tidal processes IL and LoFt on the obtained LSCI gradient. IL, LoFt explained 33\% of the spatial variability observed on LSCI (IL= 3\%; LoFt=17\%; LoFt + IL: 13\%), 6\% were attributed to the intra-station variation (ISv). Thus, high IL and rapid LoFt favor a better development of somatic-gonadal volume, probably because of longer feeding time and higher supply of food from the ocean by tide flows. Disentangling the effects of IL and LoFt on LSCI allowed to describe the spatial pattern in 61\% of variability not explained by both tidal factors. A residual gradient directed southeast-northwest highlighted that others factors, independent from IL and LoFt seems to hamper inner bay oyster reproductive performance. Consequently, investigating on the ecological functioning (Eyre influences), trophic potential and anthropogenic pressures of this zone seem crucial on the understanding of C. gigas reproductive pattern in Arcachon Bay.},

	abstract = {Summer mortality of the Paciﬁc oyster Crassostrea gigas is the result of a complex interaction between oysters, their environment and their pathogens. The physiological status of an oyster, especially its reproductive status, is suspected to play a signiﬁcant role in the outcome of this interaction. As genetic variability exists for susceptibility to summer mortality, resistant (R) and susceptible (S) oyster lines were produced using a divergent selection scheme. The present paper reports a histological study on gonad area, which is representative of reproductive effort, in randomly chosen ﬁve R and ﬁve S oyster lines. The R lines showed a signiﬁcantly lower gonad area than the S lines (P b 0.001), with an estimated mean difference of 12.5\%, whereas, taken together, R and S lines showed a similar distribution of gametogenic stages when sampled. Considering the lines separately, the signiﬁcant difference in gonad area went up to 24\% between R and S lines. The present data conﬁrm and strengthen the negative correlation between reproductive effort and resistance to summer mortality observed in previous studies. Summer mortality of C. gigas in France could, therefore, be partly due to a physiological disorder and metabolic disturbance in oysters associated with their reproductive effort. This does not, however, imply a direct link between the cost of reproduction and mortality because other causal factors, such as pathogenic agents, could be the primary causal factors.},

In this review, we identified alien marine species that have a high impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity in European seas, classified the mechanisms of impact, commented on the methods applied for assessing the impact and the related inferential strength, and reported on gaps in available information. Furthermore, we have proposed an updated inventory of 87 marine species in Europe, representing 13 phyla, which have a documented high impact on ecosystem services or biodiversity.},

	abstract = {In France, national management programs focus research on understanding reproductive factors in Crassostrea gigas to confront problems of the oyster industry. However, little information has been documented in which reproductive patterns include sexual changes. The reproductive cycle of oysters at three sites of the Atlantic coast of France was examined from 1996 to 1998, and the seasonal variations in oocyte size-frequencies, and sex ratio were described. The results showed a synchronism within the population concerning reproductive behavior. Young oocytes are generated after spawning and show no apparent changes during winter. Growth of oocytes begins in spring and cells reach maturity in April–May and are ready for a single spawning season in June–July. Oocytes that were not released during spawning are reabsorbed within the gonad. The significant difference between sites is that spawning occurred 1 month later in the southern area. A modal analysis showed that oocyte populations in the sample individuals are primordially bimodal, but with polymodal occurrences in June–July, in some cases. Irregular alternative sexuality was detected at all sites, and hermaphrodites appear to be a transition phase that allows changes from male to female during early spring. Previous observations, together with the study of the development of oocyte cohorts over time, permit a hypothetical model concerning the kinetics of gametogenesis in C. gigas. The model suggests that primary oocytes are generated from energy supplied from degenerating, as well as young oocytes that do not reach the mature stage within the gonad during autumn–winter. It seems that, during vitellogenesis, there is disintegration of smaller cells coupled with transfer of energy to the larger oocytes, which continue to grow and mature.},

As sexual maturity progressed, the glycogen content in the ovaries and testes decreased. The increases in the protein content in the ovaries corresponded with increases in oocyte diameters. The largest variations in gonadal lipids during sexual maturation occurred with the triglycerides. An increase in the ovary was associated with oogenesis and a decrease in the testis was associated with spermatogenesis. The RNA content of the ovaries was consistently greater than that of the testes, while the DNA content was lower. The RNA content and the RNA/DNA ratio are good indicators of sexual maturity in the ovary; the increasing RNA/DNA ratio in the ovary appears to show the rising synthetic activity of vitellin as one of the proteins produced within the ovary.},

	abstract = {Understanding variations in the reproductive cycle of commercial and ecologically important bivalve species is essential to address fisheries management and climate oscillation issues. Spatial and temporal trends in the reproductive cycle of Callista chione were analysed using standard histological procedures and gonadosomatic index (GSI) for two consecutive years at two coastal sites in the Adriatic Sea. Reproductive output and fecundity were analysed quantitatively to gain better insight into the seasonal energy balance with respect to gametogenesis. A seawater temperature difference of ∼4°C between the two sites likely influenced the onset and duration of spawning. At Cetina (milder temperatures), spawning was prolonged and occurred between spring and July, whereas at Pag there was only one main spawning peak in July. Both histology and GSI showed similar trends, indicating GSI to be a reliable method for analysing the main characteristics of the reproductive cycle. Conversely, the use of the body mass index (BMI) as an indicator of gonad development should be addressed carefully. Intraspecific variation in energy allocation between populations suggested life strategies modified to different habitat conditions. A higher reproductive investment and output in the Pag population directed gonadal resorption to ensure the generation of a new cycle, whereas the higher fecundity at the Cetina site indicated the production of gonads from newly available food. These results suggest successful physiological acclimatization to recent increasing temperatures.},

	abstract = {In the context of increasing demand for environmental recovery, aquatic systems may face the challenge of evolving under oligotrophication. This is the case in Mediterranean lagoons, in particular the shellfish-farmed Thau lagoon in France, where we studied recruitment of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Oyster spat and environmental parameters were monitored at several sampling sites for 3 yr (2012 to 2014) using an original method with a temporal overlap deployment of collectors to study pre- and post-settlement processes and to identify the best conditions for recruitment. Contrary to the ‘no Pacific oyster reproduction’ paradigm in Mediterranean lagoons, our study showed that recruitment of this introduced species is possible in the Thau lagoon at levels comparable to those in other traditional French breeding basins. We identified a favorable environmental window for recruitment characterized by high water temperature ({\textgreater} 26.5°C) and high nanophytoplankton and Chaetoceros spp. abundances ({\textgreater} 4.3 × 106 and 345 × 103 cells l−1, respectively). In these favorable conditions, we hypothesize that the ecosystem functions as an autotrophic system, in contrast to the heterotrophic system that characterizes unfavorable conditions. Under heterotrophic conditions, high abundances of mixotrophic and heterotrophic organisms (ciliates and dinoflagellates) limited the metamorphosis of C. gigas larvae, leading to poor recruitment. This study provides new knowledge on the reproduction of the Pacific oyster in a Mediterranean lagoon under warming and oligotrophication. The shellfish industry will profit from the discovery of spatfields to develop new nursery practices that are eco-friendly and limit risks of transfers with other spatfall areas.},

Gametogenesis begins in July and August, but follicles ripen mostly during the spring months of October and November. Maximum development is seen in November, and nearly all oysters are in spawning condition in December and January. Major spawning takes place in January or February depending upon water temperature, and spawning continues until the end of March.

	abstract = {Plastics are persistent synthetic polymers that accumulate as waste in the marine environment. Microplastic (MP) particles are derived from the breakdown of larger debris or can enter the environment as microscopic fragments. Because filter-feeder organisms ingest MP while feeding, they are likely to be impacted by MP pollution. To assess the impact of polystyrene microspheres (micro-PS) on the physiology of the Pacific oyster, adult oysters were experimentally exposed to virgin micro-PS (2 and 6 µm in diameter; 0.023 mg·L−1) for 2 mo during a reproductive cycle. Effects were investigated on ecophysiological parameters; cellular, transcriptomic, and proteomic responses; fecundity; and offspring development. Oysters preferentially ingested the 6-µm micro-PS over the 2-µm-diameter particles. Consumption of microalgae and absorption efficiency were significantly higher in exposed oysters, suggesting compensatory and physical effects on both digestive parameters. After 2 mo, exposed oysters had significant decreases in oocyte number (−38\%), diameter (−5\%), and sperm velocity (−23\%). The D-larval yield and larval development of offspring derived from exposed parents decreased by 41\% and 18\%, respectively, compared with control offspring. Dynamic energy budget modeling, supported by transcriptomic profiles, suggested a significant shift of energy allocation from reproduction to structural growth, and elevated maintenance costs in exposed oysters, which is thought to be caused by interference with energy uptake. Molecular signatures of endocrine disruption were also revealed, but no endocrine disruptors were found in the biological samples. This study provides evidence that micro-PS cause feeding modifications and reproductive disruption in oysters, with significant impacts on offspring.},

	abstract = {Two methods were used to estimate the reproductive output of female Paciﬁc oysters reared in Normandy: histology with image analysis and ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) which allowed the quantiﬁcation of egg protein. Condition indices, gonad area and gametogenetic stages of the oysters were determined in the entire population (males and females) between May and October 2005. All investigations were performed in 3 age classes: oysters in their ﬁrst, second or third years (corresponding to spat, half-grown and market-sized oysters, respectively). Both quantitative histology and ELISA provided similar results in terms of reproductive effort (illustrated by the gonado-somatic index, GSI) except during the GSI drop, corresponding to spawning, which was less marked with the ELISA method. Growth depended on oyster age, the sex ratio was well balanced and the reproductive cycle was synchronized in all age classes. In the 3 age classes, most of the oysters were ripe and ready to spawn on August 8, and ten days after the post-spawning stage was observed in 40\% of spat oysters and 70\% of half-grown and market-sized bivalves. The major difference between age classes was observed in the reproductive investment, with spat having a lower reproductive output. For example, in males and females, the gonad area reached 78–79\% in the median animal section at full maturity (August 8) in half-grown and marketable oysters while it attained only 59\% in spat. At the same time, GSI in females was, respectively in spat and the 2 oldest age classes, 33\% (quantitative histology)–36\% (ELISA) and 55\% (quantitative histology)–60\% (ELISA). The mean assessed gonad weight and fecundities increased with the age of the oysters: 1.3 g and 12 million eggs, 7.8 g and 135 million eggs, and 11.5 g and 146 million eggs in spat, half-grown and market-sized oysters, respectively. Marked differences thus appear between 2 and 3-year-old oysters and spat. As early as their ﬁrst reproductive cycle, the young oysters not only showed the reproductive features of the species in Normandy, but also a pronounced lower reproductive effort. This lower energy demand could explain their higher survival rate.},

The present study aimed to describe reproduction features of C. gigas within the Mediterranean, as well as to explore spawning triggers of this species. To achieve this goal, the reproduction cycle from gametogenesis to spawning was followed during two years in several locations within the Mediterranean Thau lagoon. The spawning behaviour of C. gigas within the Thau lagoon appeared to be slightly different from the one of the Atlantic Coast, showing several spawning events from June to October. The minimal temperature for massive spawning was 23°C, which is much higher than temperatures mentioned in the literature for this species. A strong relationship was found between phytoplankton communities and gametogenesis, the latter being improved by a higher diatom/dinoflagellate ratio. Temperature was insufficient alone to explain spawning, highlighting other potential triggers such as the moon or lightning strikes. We made the hypothesis of a hierarchy of events triggering spawning, encompassing locking, synchrony and intensifying triggers.},

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in germline development in Mollusca, the second largest animal phylum, are still poorly understood. Here we identiﬁed the Nanos orthologue from the Paciﬁc oyster Crassostrea gigas (Cg-Nanos-like), and investigated the expression patterns of Nanos during gametogenesis and embryogenesis in C. gigas. Tissue expression analysis showed that Cg-Nanos-like was speciﬁcally expressed in female gonads. During the reproductive cycle, the expression of Cg-Nanos-like mRNA increased matching the seasonal development of the ovarian tissues in diploids, while the expression levels were signiﬁcantly lower in the ovaries of sterile triploids compared to diploids. High expression of Cg-Nanos-like transcripts were detected in early embryonic stages, while the expression signiﬁcantly dropped at gastrulation and was barely detectable in veliger stages. In situ hybridization showed that Cg-Nanos-like was expressed at diﬀerent stages of developing oocytes, whereas positive signals were detected only in spermatogonia during the spermatogenic cycle. These ﬁndings indicated that CgNanos-like was involved in the development of germ cells, and maintenance of oocyte maturation. In early embryogenesis, the transcripts were broadly expressed; following gastrulation, the expression was restricted to two cell clumps, which might be the putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) or their precursors. Based on the results, the formation of the PGCs in C. gigas was consistent with the model of transition from epigenesis to preformation.},

	abstract = {Non-native populations of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) are established around the United Kingdom (UK), with two genetically different stocks originating from separate introductions to the UK and France. In this study, we use a coupled biophysical model to simulate Pacific oyster larval transport, in order to investigate the dispersal of the species from a known population near their northern limit on the west coast of the UK (in the Milford Haven Estuary). The model included a pelagic phase, simulating different swimming behaviours, and a settlement phase based on a hydrospatial substrate map. Following successful settlement elsewhere, subsequent releases simulated potential population spread over successive generations. Our results suggest that, should there be sufficiently warm sea temperatures to allow reproduction, dispersal away from Milford Haven Estuary would most be southeast ward towards the Bristol Channel; but dispersal north and west to Ireland is also possible, depending heavily on pelagic swimming behaviour. Seasonal modifications to circulation were less influential. Our study increases understanding of factors that contribute to oyster population spread, and suggests methods for improved management through numerical predictions.},

The gametogenetic cycle of this species was examined from February 2002 to January 2003 for variation in maturation stage. Environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a concentration were monitored. Initiation of gametogenesis took place in March when water temperature reached 14ÆC. Ripe oysters were observed in May at a water temperature of 20ÆC. Spawning began in June and reached a peak in September when water temperature ranged between 23ÆC and 27ÆC. During the latter period, oysters presented gonads with ruptured follicles and residual gametes. Spats, from 15 to 20 mm in length, were observed in November 2002 fixed under other oysters. Complementary studies have to be performed, but the present contribution could be of significance for the Tunisian oyster industry, which until now remains dependent on French spat importation.},

	abstract = {Ingestion, growth and metamorphosis of Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, larvae were studied under
controlled conditions of food density and temperature using a combination of a flow-through rearing system
and a hydrobiological monitoring device. In a first experiment larvae were exposed to three different
phytoplankton densities (12, 20 and 40 cells µl−1
) while in a second trial larvae were reared at five different
temperatures (17, 22, 25, 27 and 32 °C). Both food concentration and temperature significantly affected the
larval physiology throughout the entire development from D-veliger to young spat. Larvae survived over a
wide range of both environmental parameters with high survival at the end of experiments. The feeding
functional response provided the maximal ingestion rate (50 000 cells larva−1 day−1
) which occurred at an
algal density of 20 cells µl−1 surrounding the larvae and 25 °C. At the highest temperature (32 °C), maximal
growth and metamorphosis performances were reached in less than 2 weeks while the lowest temperature
(17 °C) consistently inhibited ingestion and growth over the entire larval period. The estimate of the
Arrhenius temperature (TA) was 11 000 K for C. gigas larvae. Larval development could be divided on the basis
of feeding activity into an initial mixotrophic period with a lower and constant ingestion over the first days
(from D-stage to early umbonate larva of ≈110 µm length) followed by an exotrophic phase characterized by a
sharp increase in ingestion (umbonate to eyed of ≈300 µm length) and, finally, a third period for larvae
≥300 µm during which ingestion decreased suddenly because of metamorphosis. Optimum larval
development and settlement of the oyster C. gigas occurred at 27 °C and an increasing food supply as the
larvae were growing. A food density of ≥20 cells µl−1 of T-ISO + CP or CG (1:1 cells number) in the culture
water was required to maximise growth and metamorphosis success.},

Using satellite imagery and field and aerial inspections we found 10 oyster beds that cover less than 0.05\% of the bay intertidal (area covered: 36.45 ha). These beds are restricted to intertidal zones with superficial hard substrata (limestone outcrops). Most epifaunal organisms (the crabs Cyrtagrapsus angulatus, Chasmagnathus granulatus, the isopod Melita palmata. and the snail Heleobia australis) showed higher densities inside oyster beds compared with outside and experiments showed that artificially deployed oyster beds increased the densities of their at three intertidal zones (high intertidal marsh, low intertidal marsh. and low intertidal with hard substrata) and also increased densities of infaunal organisms (the polychaetes Laeonereis acuta, Nepthys fluviatilis, and the priapulid Priapulus tuberculatospinosus) at the low intertidal with hard substrata. This may be the result of increasing habitat structure and refuge for epifaunal organisms, and enhancement of deposition and sediment stability that may benefit infaunal organisms. Densities bird species (Local species: Larus dominicanus, Haematopus palliatits: Regional migratory shorebird: Charadrius falklandicus; Long range migratory shorebirds: Pluvialis dominica, Calidris canutus, Tringa flavipes) were higher inside oyster beds compared with similar zones without oysters, which may be the result of higher prey availability. Foraging rate was also higher for some of these species (P. dominica, C. falklandicus). However, due to the limited availability of hard substratum the distribution of oysters is small. In conclusion, no negative effects were observed as a result of this introduction. There was an increase in species abundance and the area was preferred by local and migratory bird species, which also showed higher feeding rates.},

Despite having been cultured along the South African coast for 30 years, this is the first record of naturalized populations of this well known global invader from the region.

Populations of 184,206 ± 21 058.9 (SE), 876 ± 604.2 (SE) and 1 228 ± 841.8 (S.E.) individuals were recorded in the Breede, Goukou and Knysna estuaries respectively.

The condition index of oysters in the Goukou and Knysna estuaries differed significantly from those in the Breede Estuary (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA H = 48.249, P {\textless} 0.01) but no difference was found between the Goukou and Knysna estuaries (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA H = 48.249, P {\textgreater} 0.05).

Seasonal changes in growth, reproductive condition, and digestive tubule atrophy (DTA) of these “hardened/stunted” oysters were monitored for more than a year after transplanting to a suspended longline system in a grow-out area in the bay. After transplantation, the hardened/stunted oysters showed a logarithmic increase in shell size for the first 4 mo, from June to October, and growth remained stable from late fall to early spring. During the 12 mo of the grow-out, the shell size of the hardened/stunted oysters increased from 15.4–74.2 mm, and tissue weight increased from 0.49–12.85 g. Histological analysis revealed that gametogenesis of hardened/stunted oysters commenced as early as February when water temperature remained at 10°C, and spawning occurred from July to September when water temperature reached 25–27°C. DTA assessed from histological analysis was higher from September to February, when the chlorophyll a level in the bay was lower. These data suggest that seasonal fluctuations in water temperature and food availability in the water column are the 2 main environmental parameters governing reproduction and growth of oyster in Gamakman Bay, and DTA could be a useful biomarker for monitoring the nutritional condition of oysters.},

	abstract = {The introduction of a non-native species frequently has adverse direct effects on native species. The underlying mechanisms, however, often remain unclear, in particular where native and invasive species are taxonomically similar. We found evidence of direct competitive interactions between a globally distributed invasive species (the Pacific oyster, Magallana gigas) and its native counterpart (the European oyster, Ostrea edulis). We also discovered that the competitive outcome differed between different habitat types and orientation by identifying context-dependent responses driven by environmental conditions and stress (i.e. intertidal compared to subtidal habitats; and vertical versus horizontal substratum). This is particularly important because the European oyster is threatened, or in decline, throughout most of its range, and restoration efforts are underway in many regions. We combined experimental manipulations and stable isotope analysis (SIA) to identify the direct effects of competition and the mechanisms by which the invasive and native species compete. We identified negative effects of the invasive species on the native oyster, but these were limited to the subtidal habitat (lower stress environment) and determined by substratum orientation (habitat structure). Crucially, we found that effects of the invasive species on the native species were not always negative and under certain conditions (e.g. on vertical substrata) were positive. Shifts in isotopic niches of both species when co-occurring, alongside mixing models, indicate that exploitative competition for food is most likely to underpin niche partitioning between both species. We have identified different foraging strategies under different contexts, and our findings highlight the importance of exploitative competition as a driving mechanism behind the co-occurrence of two seemingly functionally similar consumers. The combination of experimental manipulations with SIA is a powerful tool, and we illustrate how this approach should be incorporated, into multiple environmental contexts at appropriate scales, to more accurately predict impacts of the spread of invasive species on native communities.},

Water samplings for physicochemical and biological variables were conducted from March 2002 to November 2007 at three stations along the bay. The phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms throughout the year, with the minimum species diversity in summer and the maximum in autumn. A total of 100 diatoms were identified and classified according to their seasonal occurrence in the plankton; some were consistently present throughout the whole year, but a large fraction showed a distinct seasonal cycle. The inner two stations differed significantly in terms of phytoplankton biomass and nutrient content from the outer station, indicating a higher nutrient input in the inner part. The majority of the dominant diatoms recorded in this study prefer nutrient-enriched conditions. Due to the anticipated increase of human impact in the area, this study can serve as a base for future environmental studies in Lim Bay.},

Both species generally showed a similar diet, with copepod and decapod larvae as dominant prey groups. The composition of anchovy and sardine stomach contents was not size- or sex-related, but throughout the year, a significant difference in diet composition was observed for each species as well as between species. Two gastrointerstinal helminths; the digenean Parahemiurus merus and nematode Hysterothylacium aduncum, were recorded during the stomach content analysis. Differences in population dynamics between the two parasites are congruent with differences in the prey composition of sardine and anchovy, reflecting fine-tuned interactions in the trophic web between parasites and intermediate or paratenic hosts included in the sardine and anchovy diet.},

It is a sedentary filter-feeding organism that assimilates carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in tissues from its food sources. The δ13C and δ15N values have been used to demonstrate differences in isotopic composition between digestive gland, muscle and gills of this mussel. For δ13C, mean values were -21.99±0.50‰, -19.70±0.44‰, and -19.96±0.44‰, respectively; and for δ15N, they were 5.16±0.90‰, 7.67±0.79‰ and 7.77±0.85‰, respectively. The fractionation or enrichment factor for 13C values between digestive gland and muscle, between digestive gland and gills, and between muscle and gills were -2.29±0.16‰, -2.04±0.14‰ and 0.27±0.07‰, respectively, within the expected range of 13C fractionation at filter feeders reported elsewhere. In contrast, low fractionation values were found for 15N with -2.45±0.24‰, -2.51±0.16‰ and -0.11±0.16‰, between digestive gland and muscle, between digestive gland and gills, and between muscle and gills, respectively. Through isotopic fractionation of M. galloprovincialis, the depleted values were found in the digestive gland, followed by gills and then by muscle tissue. Statistical analysis (PERMANOVA) was performed to check for significant differences in δ13C and δ15N isotopic signatures between tissues and localities. The current study demonstrates significant differences in the δ13C and δ15N isotopic composition between digestive gland, muscle and gills tissues in M. galloprovincialis living in the oligotrophic environment of the Balearic Islands.},

Key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. Methodology By accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of Bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. Conclusions We outline a framework that builds on recently published Bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source R package, SIAR. The formulation in R will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.},

Half-life values in bivalves were about two times longer for carbon (around 8.5days) than for nitrogen (14.5days). We then used species-specific fractionation values to re-estimate contributions of food sources to the diets of similar suspension-feeding species, for which standard fractionation values had been assumed in previous studies.

We compared variation in δ13C and δ15N, or isotopic niche, in the tissues of matched pairs of highly successful and less successful (respectively) freshwater and marine aquatic invasive species: violet tunicate Botrylloides violaceus and golden star tunicate Botryllus schlosseri from the northwest Atlantic coast; spiny waterflea Bythotrephes longimanus and fishhook waterflea Cercopagis pengoi from the Great Lakes basin; and Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica from the northeast Pacific coast. Individual (δ13C and δ15N) and population (Bayesian ellipses of δ13C and δ15N) level comparisons of isotopic niche revealed, in most cases, greater niche breadth in the more successful species of tunicate but the less successful species of waterflea and oyster. Comparison with the literature suggested that a broad dietary niche is less crucial for widespread distribution of aquatic invasive invertebrates than it is for vertebrates (i.e., fishes). Inconsistency in the association between isotopic niche breadth and invasion success could be due to a greater influence of habitat suitability on variation in invertebrate diets. These findings challenge the common assumption that a broader niche promotes invasion success, and thus, have implications for invasive species risk assessment, management, and our understanding of species spread and distribution.},

A stable isotope approach was used to investigate potential trophic niche separation between co-existing rocky shore crabs in the North-West (NW) Arabian Gulf. Leptodius exaratus and Pilumnopeus convexus which occupy similar shore height on the same rocky intertidal habitats. We also investigated conspecific differences between males vs females and adults vs juveniles. δ15N results indicated that adults of both species occupy a high trophic level in the rocky shore community, suggesting similar functional roles and potential for competition for food resources, while significant differences in δ13C values indicated differences in dietary sources between the two species, and also changes in diet between juveniles and adults in both species. MixSIAR analysis of δ15N and δ13C data confirmed field observations that both species are generalist omnivores, with potential for direct competition including adult predation on juveniles, including conspecifics. Differentiation in isotopic niches (SIBER analysis) was mainly driven by the significant differences in δ13C values, suggesting that co-existence of the two crab species is at least in part mediated by trophic niche separation or dietary resource partitioning, with some (unquantified) potential for spatial resource partitioning at the microhabitat level.},

	abstract = {This analysis deals with size variations in the breeding territories of land birds which obtain most or all of their food on the territory. For the species studied as a whole, territory size shows a strong positive relationship to body weight. Predators tend to have larger territories than omnivores or herbivores of the same weight, presumably due to the relatively denser food of the latter species. The home ranges of raptors inhabiting two areas were found to be significantly correlated with an index of the numerical density of their prey and in one area with raptor weight. Higher clutch size is not significantly associated with larger territories in any category of birds tested. The number of individuals defending the territory and the number feeding the young are probably not correlated with territory size. The exponential relationships between body weight of the consumer and three dependent variables--food biomass consumed per unit time, average prey weight and territory or home range size--are used to derive three predictions: a) Heavier predators take fewer individuals per unit time than lighter species; b) If certain restrictions are satisfied, the collective biomasses in a given large area increase as individual biomasses become larger for omnivorous species and decrease as individual biomasses increase for predators; c) For predators, the density of acceptable and accessible food in biomass per unit area decreases as the weight of the consumer increases. Territory or home range size increases more rapidly with body weight for predators than for omnivores or herbivores. This relationship holds true for both birds and mammals and presumably reflects a rapidly decreasing food density for predators of increasing weight. Since smaller predators do not feed over a wider range of food size than larger species, and since there are less species or individuals feeding on large food than on small, the predators of the areas studied probably consume food whose distribution of biomass with food size is declining. The habit of feeding on exclusive areas is considerably more widespread among predators than among omnivores and herbivores. The smaller spatial needs for omnivorous and herbivorous birds of a given biomass and perhaps the greater patchiness of their food when compared to predators are used to explain the higher occurrence of gregarious nesting in the former group. Implications of this study for the functions of feeding territories maintained during the breeding season are discussed.},

	abstract = {Restoring and conserving coastal resilience faces increasing challenges under current climate change predictions. Oyster restoration, in particular, faces threats from alterations in precipitation, warming water temperatures, and urbanization of coastlines that dramatically change salinity patterns, foster the proliferation and spread disease, and disrupt habitat connectivity, respectively. New York City (NYC) coastal waters, once home to a booming oyster fishery for eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica), are now nearly devoid of live oyster reefs. Oyster restoration in urban estuaries is motivated by the synergistic ecosystem benefits this native keystone species can deliver. Recent surveys have documented substantial remnant populations of adult oysters in the upper low salinity zone of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary (HRE) near Tarrytown, NY. This study assessed fitness-related performance across the HRE salinity gradient to evaluate habitat suitability on an estuarine scale. Oysters were hatchery-produced from wild, moderate-salinity broodstock, then outplanted for measurement of growth, survival, reproduction and disease prevalence over two years. Survival was generally higher in the lower salinity river sites and in the higher salinity Jamaica Bay sites relative to mesohaline NYC harbor sites. Growth rate was highest in Jamaica Bay and had high variation among other sites. Surprisingly, the highest proportion of individuals with sex-differentiated gametes and the highest average gonad maturation index was found at a low salinity site. Consistent with the advanced gametogenesis measured in experimental animals at low salinity, annual wild recruitment was documented near the low salinity remnant population in each of five monitored years. These results suggest that the remnant HRE oyster population is a robust, self-sustaining population that can be leveraged to support restoration of subpopulations in other parts of the estuary, but further research is required to determine if the mesohaline and near-ocean reaches of the HRE can support the full oyster life cycle.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Thau Lagoon is an important oyster farming area in Europe. Oyster growth rates are among the highest in France, although chlorophyll a concentration is low. Previous studies have demonstrated that picophytoplankton, nano-microphytoplankton, dinoflagellates and loricate ciliates such as tintinnids are abundant. However, heterotrophic flagellates and aloricate ciliates have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess picophytoplankton, protist and zooplankton abundances in the Lagoon and to investigate the particular structure of the microbial food web, which may explain such paradoxical oyster growth. In oligotrophic waters in the Thau Lagoon, the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus tauri is the dominant autotrophic picoplankter, with an abundance maximum in summer. On 17 August 1998, following a rainfall event, pico- and nanophytoplankton abundances were not as high as expected and we observed a high abundance of large diatoms. At this time, the available carbon resources were produced by microphytoplankton (84.5\%), and picoplanktonic cells represented only 1.27\% in terms of carbon. Heterotrophic cells were low in abundance and constituted {\textless}14\% of carbon resources. In order to evaluate the importance of the ‘protozoan trophic link’ for energy transfer from the microbial food web to large benthic suspension feeders, the oyster Crassostrea gigas was offered a planktonic community as potential prey. In the grazing experiment, all {\textgreater} 5 µm flagellates, microphytoplankton, dinoflagellates, ciliates and large zooplankton were retained by the oyster gills. Only flagellates {\textless} 5 µm and O. tauri were not very well retained (45 and 2\% respectively). The high clearance rates of C. gigas found in this experiment can be explained by a low concentration of suspended particulate matter (0.65 mg l–1). The oysters adapted their retention mechanism when they lived in oligotrophic waters. These results indicate that, under the given experimental conditions, picophytoplankton did not represent a valuable trophic resource for farmed oysters because (1) C. gigas cannot retain picoparticles and (2) the picoplankton represented a poor carbon resource capable of being transferred via a weak heterotrophic protist community. In the oyster pens of the Thau Lagoon during this study, microphytoplanktonic primary producers, in particular diatoms, were the main food sources for bivalve suspension feeders.},

	abstract = {Introduced bivalves have suppressed phytoplankton production in many aquatic foodwebs, but effects on higher trophic levels have been inconsistent. In the northern San Francisco Estuary, the introduced clam Corbula amurensis eliminated summer-long phytoplankton blooms starting in 1987, but responses of mesozooplankton biomass and most fish were somewhat muted. I conducted a retrospective analysis of the response of the estuarine foodweb to the decline in phytoplankton due to clam grazing. When C. amurensis invaded, the distribution of northern anchovy Engraulis mordax shifted toward higher salinity, reducing summer abundance by 94\% in the low-salinity region of the estuary. Northern anchovy dominates the biomass of fish in the more saline reaches of the estuary, and is genetically affiliated with the subpopulation on the central California coast, which in turn is strongly influenced by climate variability. However, abundance of northern anchovy within the estuary was not related to available estimates of biomass, catch, or abundance of northern anchovy on the California coast, nor was it related to any of 4 variables describing aspects of climate variability with different time and space scales. The shift in spatial distribution appears to have been a direct behavioral response to reduced food. Bioenergetic calculations showed reduced consumption of zooplankton by all planktivores, including mysids, after C. amurensis became abundant and the anchovy left the low-salinity region of the estuary. This reduced consumption appears to have mitigated effects of the loss of phytoplankton productivity, making a greater proportion of the zooplankton productivity available to other fish species. Such behavioral accommodations are likely wherever invasions occur in open systems.Erratum},

However, the indirect effects of this invader on other trophic groups have been inconsistent and difficult to interpret. In some lakes, zebra mussels appear to have had little effect on zooplankton density, despite decreasing the abundance of their phytoplankton prey. We analyze food web models to test hypothesized mechanisms for the absence of a strong effect of dreissenids on zooplankton. Our results suggest that neither reduced inedible algal interference with zooplankton filtering nor reduced phytoplankton self-shading is sufficient to explain the insensitivity of zooplankton populations to dreissenid competition. Instead, we show how the impact of benthic filter feeders can be influenced by the rate of mixing within a basin, which limits phytoplankton delivery to the benthos. We explore the predictions of a simple spatially structured model and demonstrate that differences in abiotic factors that control mixing can result in large differences in direct and indirect effects of zebra mussel filtering.},

With millions of years and a vast volume of water to call their home, they have become quite adept at developing specialized and unique techniques for survival and – given increasing human mediated transport – biological invasions. A growing world human population and a global economy drives the transportation of goods across the oceans and with them invasive species via ballast water and attached to ship hulls. In any given 24-hour period, there are about 10,000 species being transported across different biogeographic regions. If any of them manage to take hold and establish a range in an exotic habitat, the implications for local ecosystems can be costly. This review on marine invasions highlights trends among successful non-indigenous species (NIS), from vectors of transport to ecological and physiological plasticity. Apart from summarizing patterns of successful invasions, it discusses the implications of how successfully established NIS impact the local environment, economy and human health. Finally, it looks to the future and discusses what questions need to be addressed and what models can tell us about what the outlook on future marine invasions is.},

	abstract = {Under controlled conditions of food density and temperature, larval performances (ingestion, growth, survival and settlement success) of the flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, were investigated using a flow-through rearing system. In the first experiment, oyster larvae were reared at five different phytoplankton densities (70, 500, 1500, 2500 and 3500 μm3 μL−1: ≈1, 8, 25, 42 and 58 cells μL−1 equivalent TCg), and in the second, larvae were grown at four different temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30°C). Overall, larvae survived a wide range of food density and temperature, with high survival recorded at the end of the experiments. Microalgae concentration and temperature both impacted significantly larval development and settlement success. A mixed diet of Chaetoceros neogracile and Tisochrysis lutea (1:1 cell volume) maintained throughout the whole larval life at a concentration of 1500 μm3 μL−1 allowed the best larval development of O. edulis at 25°C with high survival (98\%), good growth (16 μm day−1) and high settlement success (68\%). In addition, optimum larval development (survival ≥97\%; growth ≥17 μm day−1) and settlement (≥78\%) were achieved at 25 and 30°C, at microalgae concentrations of 1500 μm3 μL−1. In contrast, temperature of 20°C led to lower development (≤10 μm day−1) and weaker settlement (≤27\%), whereas at 15°C, no settlement occurred. The design experiments allowed the estimation of the maximum surface-area-specific ingestion rate = 120 ± 4 μm3 day−1 μm−2, the half saturation coefficient XK = 537 ± 142 μm3 μL−1 and the Arrhenius temperature TA = 8355 K.

Relatively little is known about particle selection by O. edulis, and the goal of the present study was to establish baselines for particle selection by both oyster species under controlled conditions in the laboratory. The study was carried out with adult oysters of similar shell size collected in the Limfjord estuary, Denmark (56°47′N, 08°51′E), in November 2011. The feeding traits of both species [clearance rate (CR), retention efficiency (RE) and lower threshold for clearance (LTC)] were compared using five algal species with different cell sizes (5−32 µm ESD) (Isochrysis galbana, Rhodomonas salina, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Prorocentrum micans and Akashiwo sanguinea). Oysters were acclimated to an experimental temperature of 22 °C and a salinity of 25. The CR of O. edulis was one to three times lower than that of C. gigas for the three smaller algal species (5−15 µm) but not different for the two larger algae. Algae in the size range 7−32 µm were retained with 100\% RE by both oysters, but the smallest alga was retained with reduced RE ({\textasciitilde}35\%). There were no differences in LTC between the two oysters. A closer examination of the relationship between LTC and different measures of the algae present (cell size, cell volume, chl a, C and N) suggests that the LTC, and also the CR, may depend in part on the internal energy status of the oysters.},

	abstract = {The Pacific oyster Magallana gigas, globally one of the most translocated marine species, has never been commercially farmed in any part of the Croatian eastern Adriatic Sea, where the native flat oyster Ostrea edulis is the only cultured oyster species. The Pacific oyster has, however, established populations on the west coast of the Istria peninsula, in the northeast Adriatic Sea. Current distribution, abundance and size structure of the flat and Pacific oysters were studied there along spatial and depth gradients in natural and artificial habitats to assess their potential for coexistence. This is the first quantitative assessment of native and non-native oyster populations on a Mediterranean-wide scale providing a baseline for determining future changes in their distribution. Both species were omnipresent, with the Pacific oyster displaying a more pronounced variability in abundance and size in relation to survey regions and depths. The population density of flat oysters was low, generally less than 1 individual/m2, with no difference among regions. The density of the Pacific oyster was significantly higher, being on average 5 individuals/m2. Dense, reef-forming aggregations of Pacific oysters were contained in Lim Bay, a nationally-important shellfish aquaculture area, where its mean density was 107 individuals/m2. Along the open coastline its densities were considerably lower and followed a latitudinal gradient. The observed abundance and size distribution patterns of the Pacific oyster suggest that Lim Bay was the introduction point, with feral settlement likely originating from short-lived experimental aquaculture trials and subsequently dispersing by prevailing local currents. The flat oysters were larger in size and settled at different depths compared to the Pacific oysters. The vertical range of Pacific oysters was mostly contained in the tidal zone, while flat oysters were present in the subtidal exclusively. Such spatial partitioning likely resulted from introduced oysters occupying a vacant ecological niche and not due to interspecific competitive exclusion. Habitat type had a strong effect on proliferation of Pacific oysters. Artificial hard substrata harboured more abundant and larger Pacific oysters than the natural rocky shore habitat. The possibility of multiple local introduction pathways in ports and marinas is also discussed. Currently, there seems to be no spatial competition between the two oyster species, but as it is hard to predict future possible impacts of non-native species, we strongly suggest regular monitoring of the Pacific oyster, prioritising sensitive and protected areas as well as areas at the edge of its distribution.},

However, the species has never been officially introduced for commercial farming in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea. Interestingly, in the 1970s, the Pacific oyster has been reported in the natural habitats of the Lim Bay, in northern Adriatic Sea. Although the species was recorded there, there is a lack of knowledge about its biology and ecology in this region, including a reproductive cycle. Information on the reproductive biology of non-indigenous species in new areas is crucial for prediction of their future survival and possible spread in invaded habitats. In this study, we provide the first data on the reproductive biology of the Pacific oyster in the Adriatic Sea, the northernmost part of the Mediterranean Sea. Quantitative and qualitative methods of gonad tissue analysis were conducted, and effects of environmental conditions on the gametogenesis were evaluated during two reproductive cycles. Our study confirmed that environmental conditions in the Lim Bay were favourable for the reproduction of the species. The Pacific oyster reproduced once per year and had a prolonged spawning period. Water temperature was the main factor affecting gonad development and oocyte size, while chlorophyll a concentration had an impact on the oocyte development in terms of their size.},

	abstract = {Benthic filter feeders have the potential to control phytoplankton biomass and size composition in shallow estuaries and fjords, while the in situ impact on the zooplankton community is so far unknown. In a companion study, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis was shown to graze on both micro- and mesozooplankton causing depletion above the mussel bed (Nielsen \& Maar, Mar Ecol Prog Ser 339:185–198). However, the vertical zooplankton distribution varied between sampling days, and we thus examined the influence of turbulence on the escape capability of different zooplankton organisms. Two sampling days were selected for further analysis representing relatively low (ε ≈ 10–7 m2 s–3) and high (ε ≈ 10–6 m2 s–3) near-bed turbulence (estimated by a physical water column model, General Ocean Turbulence Model, GOTM). The grazing impact on the zooplankton was estimated by a random walk model taking zooplankton motility and escape behaviour into account as well as turbulence conditions. Protozooplankton and bivalve larvae were always captured efficiently by mussels irrespective of turbulence conditions, while the grazing impact on nauplii and copepodites was greatly reduced due to increased escape success in low turbulence conditions. Thus, the zooplankton community will be more diverse during low turbulence conditions and will compete with mussels for phytoplankton food. Seasonal importance of the different components of the pelagic food web for mussel consumption was evaluated by comparing the model results with plankton data from the studied fjord system. The analysis stresses the need, when evaluating the ecological role of mussels, to also consider the heterotrophic components of the food web.},

Therefore we investigated the distributions of both chl a and zooplankton across a cultivation raft of blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis during summer in the Ría de Vigo, NW Spain. Our hypothesis was that zooplankton is depleted in the immediate region of the raft, but that the degree of depletion varies between prey types and therefore differs from that of chl a. We observed a significant average depletion of 57\% for chl a and of 26 to 77\% for different zooplankton groups at the lower edge and downstream of the raft. At the lowest current speeds, removal rates of protozooplankton, nauplii and copepodites were lower than for chl a, indicating that zooplankton escaped filtration. In contrast, removal rates of zooplankton {\textgreater}150 µm increased with current speed and exceeded those of chl a at the highest current speeds. This was due to additional filtration by passive filter feeders such as barnacles and hydroids. The present study demonstrates the effect of the raft epifaunal community on the structure of the zooplankton community in the upper productive layer, and stresses the importance of including heterotrophic plankton in estimates of potential bivalve production.},

Flow direction and current speed were measured using an Aanderaa current meter and fine-scale Acoustic Doppler Velcimeter probes at different positions in the raft. Flow speeds were reduced compared to outside the raft, but a clear tidal signal and significant flow velocities could still be observed inside the raft. At the upstream corners of the raft, a zone of high turbulence but reduced advection was observed. Concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a) were measured on 3 different spatial scales. On a macro-scale, fluorescence profiles were taken inside and outside the raft on several occasions and there was depletion of chlorophyll inside the raft corresponding to {\textasciitilde}80\% of the outside concentration, whereas there was no depletion below the ropes. On a meso-scale, from just upstream to just downstream of the raft, fluorescence profiles, as well as water samples, at several depths revealed similar depletion, however, with larger depletion of size-fractionated chl a {\textgreater}2 µm. On a micro-scale, water was sampled within 20 cm of the ropes using siphon mimics. In the middle of the raft, concentration profiles towards the mussel ropes could be observed at 2 depths, whereas less clear profiles were observed on the turbulent upstream corner.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Oyster culture structures support a host of epibionts belonging to the same suspension-feeding guild, which are considered to be potential competitors for food with cultivated oysters. In an intertidal shellfish ecosystem on the northern French coast, an approach based on stable isotopes (13C and 15N) was used to investigate intra- and interspecific food resource partitioning among cultivated oysters and the main associated wild sessile epibionts such as polychaetes, barnacles, mussels and ascidians. The main objective of the present study was to determine inter- and intraspecific food partitioning, along with small-scale spatial variability, within the guild of suspension feeders. We demonstrated that interspecific competition was limited among co-occurring suspension-feeders (ascidians, serpulid and terebellid polychaetes, bivalves and barnacles). None of the studied species had similar δ13C and δ15N signatures, indicating that relative contributions of organic matter sources may differ for each suspension-feeding species. Spatial variability was investigated both from the view of intra- and interspecific variability. Intraspecific variability was examined with regard to species’ feeding biology and the trophic plasticity of co-occurring suspension-feeders. Mantel tests indicated that spatial heterogeneity resulted not only from environmental conditions, such as elevation above sea level (a.s.l.) and sediment features, but also from the inherent spatial structure of isotopic signatures. Our results show that isotopic approaches that are limited to sampling in one area and at one time are at risk of mistaking trophic interactions.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of bivalve food sources has great importance in aquaculture areas where cultured species usually occur at higher densities than in natural populations. Except phytoplankton, which is considered as their primary food sources, bivalves can use other food sources such as detritus, bacteria and zooplankton. The objective of this study was to determine food sources of four commercially important bivalve species co-existing in the Mali Ston Bay — most important aquaculture area of the eastern Adriatic Sea. Food sources were investigated by analyzing the fatty acid profiles of digestive gland and muscle tissues of the European flat oyster Ostrea edulis and the black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, cultured in the water column, and the bearded horse mussel Modiolus barbatus and Noah's ark shell Arca noae from natural populations. Digestive gland fatty acid analysis revealed that during the period of higher plankton abundance in spring and summer, all species ingested mainly phytoplankton followed by zooplankton and detritus. During the low plankton abundance of the autumn–winter period zooplankton and/or detritus became more important in a bivalve diet. Fatty acid composition of muscles indicated differences in selective incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) from their diets. While A. noae and M. barbatus accumulated significantly PUFAs during all and O. edulis during spring–summer period, in M. galloprovincialis this tendency was not observed at all. This suggested better utilization of ingested food in bottom-dwelling species. Because all four species consumed similar food sources they were in competition. However, as investigated species in Mali Ston Bay exist in high density, primary production plus the availability of other food sources in this area was probably sufficient to satisfy demands for all species. Aquaculture in the study area depends wholly on natural spat. This suggests that larviphagy, observed for all species, might constitute a self-regulating restriction to natural populations and/or commercial aquaculture growth.},

The relative significance of the impact of the 2 species on phytoplankton density during a tidal cycle was estimated by combining field measurements of clearance rates and modelling of the bivalve bed (topography, biomass distribution, temporal and spatial water coverage and depth). The average density of C. gigas and M. edulis was 35 ± 36 and 1001 ± 685 ind. m−2, respectively. The water volume cleared during a tidal cycle was estimated at 45 838 m3, of which C. gigas and M. edulis contributed 9169 and 36 669 m3, respectively. Therefore, M. edulis contributed 4 times as much as C. gigas to the bivalve bed’s clearance, and the 2 bivalves were estimated to clear the water volume 1.9 times during each tidal cycle. However, the estimated water column cleared during low tide is overestimated due to phytoplankton depletion. Hence, it is concluded that the bivalve bed clears the water close to 1 time each tidal cycle. This, together with a low dry weight of soft parts, indicates that the bivalve bed, in general, is food-limited.},

	abstract = {The native Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, was once abundant in many US Pacific Northwest (PNW) estuaries, but was decimated by human activity in the late nineteenth early to twentieth centuries. Having been the subject of only few modern, detailed studies, a dearth of basic physiological information surrounded O. lurida and how it compared to the now dominant, non-native Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Utilizing laboratory and in situ studies in Yaquina Bay, OR, we explored the clearance rates of both species across a wide range of conditions. Pacific oysters not only had greater size-specific clearance rates than Olympia oysters, but also had a lower optimum temperature. Clearance rates for both species were reduced at lower salinity, at lower organic content, and at higher turbidity. Clearance rate models were constructed for each species using three approaches: (1) a single mechanistic model that incorporated feeding response functions of each species to the effects of temperature, salinity, turbidity, and seston organic content based on laboratory studies; (2) another additive model in which the number and type of response functions from laboratory studies were allowed to vary; and (3) a statistical model that utilized environmental data collected during in situ feeding trials. Clearance rate models that correlated feeding activity with in situ environmental data were found to often better predict oyster clearance rates (based on Adj R2) for both species in Yaquina Bay, OR, than mechanistic, additive models based on laboratory feeding response functions; however, in situ correlative models varied in accuracy by species and season. This work represents important first steps towards better understanding the physiological ecology of the native Olympia oyster and how it differs from introduced and now dominant Pacific oyster.},

	abstract = {Estuarine food webs are generally considered to be supported by marine pelagic and benthic primary producers and by the import of dead organic matter from the open sea. Although estuaries receive considerable amounts of freshwater phytoplankton and organic compounds from adjacent rivers, the potential contribution of these living and dead matter to estuarine food webs is often assumed to be negligible and, therefore, not examined. Based on stable isotope analyses, we report the importance of freshwater suspended particulate organic matter (FW-SPOM) for fuelling estuarine food webs in comparison to estuarine SPOM and microphytobenthos. This previously neglected food source contributed 50–60\% (annual average) of food intake of suspension-feeding bivalves such as cockles (Cerastoderma edule), mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas) at the Balgzand tidal flats, an estuarine site in the western Wadden Sea (12–32 psu). For these species, this proportion was particularly high in autumn during strong run-off of SPOM-rich freshwater, whilst estuarine SPOM (20\%-25\%) and microphytobenthos (15\%-30\%) were relatively important in summer when the freshwater run-off was very low. These findings have implications for our understanding of the trophic interactions within coastal food webs and for freshwater management of estuarine ecosystems.},

This study compares the food selectivity of oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1973), mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck, 1819), and cockles Katelysia rhytiphora (Lamy, 197) on natural particle assemblages in the laboratory using water collected from Coffin Bay, South Australia, in spring, summer, autumn and winter. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Bacillariophyceae (diatoms), Dinophyceae (dinoflagellates), Synechococcus (cyanobacteria), and picophytoplankton (2–5 μm) from September 2016 to August 2017. Diatoms and picoplankton, including cyanobacteria, were dominant in spring and summer, while dinoflagellates were dominant in autumn and winter. Oysters and mussels selectively fed on large food particles (e.g., diatom, dinoflagellate and large picoplankton {\textgreater} 2 μm) regardless of season, but mussels could access a wider size spectrum of food particles compared to oysters. In contrast, cockles selected for both large and small food particles (e.g., Synechococcus and small picoeukaryotes {\textless} 2 μm) and fed more efficiently on small particles than both oysters and mussels. Bacteria were more abundant in warmer seasons, but mussels and cockles selectively reduced bacterial abundance. The abundance of virus-like particles was not affected by season nor by filtration of any molluscan species. This study demonstrates that oysters and mussels utilise similar food sources, whereas cockles consume a large range of food particles. Additionally, these three molluscan species do not necessarily compete for food; hence, stocking multiple filter-feeding species in an ecosystem could exploit a wider spectrum of food particle size and increase system productivity.},

As a consequence, total filtration pressure increased significantly, which may affect the mortality of bivalve larvae. Better escape abilities in Pacific oyster larvae might be a contributing factor to their rapid geographic expansion. To study whether C. gigas larvae are filtered less than larvae of native bivalves, we investigated filtration and ingestion of the larvae of the native Mytilus edulis and introduced C. gigas by the adults of C. gigas and M. edulis as well as the native Cerastoderma edule. We measured filtration rates of C. gigas and M. edulis larvae by the adult bivalves (C. gigas, M. edulis and C. edule), and compared these to filtration rates of algae. Additionally, we studied the fate of filtered larvae. All three adult species filtered both C. gigas and M. edulis larvae. M. edulis larvae were filtered by all three bivalve species with the same filtration rates as algae, whereas filtration rates of C. gigas larvae were roughly 50\% lower than filtration rates of algae. This suggests that C. gigas larvae can somehow reduce their filtration risk, whereas larvae of M. edulis cannot. The majority of filtered C. gigas and M. edulis larvae were ingested.},

This eliminates the major uptake of ⁵¹Cr which is transferred to the ctenidia and palps of the suspension-feeding mussel Aulacomya ater (Molina) from detritus labelled with ⁵¹Cr. The results suggest that although bacterial cultures based on isolates of kelp bacteria can be absorbed with an efficiency of 67 to 70 \%, the debris itself is also absorbed with an efficiency of approximately 50 \%. The kelp debris, which forms an important component of the particulate matter potentially available for consumers, may thus represent an important source of carbon for the filter feeding community adjacent to kelp beds. In contrast to the results obtained in other studies with artificial food sources, the data for kelp debris suggest that A. ater is able to maintain a positive scope for growth at the concentrations of suspended organic matter which occur under natural conditions in the kelp bed environment.},

	abstract = {The feeding ecology of the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, was investigated within three intertidal mussel beds along Ninety Mile Beach, northern New Zealand, between August 2000 and March 2001. Adult mussels of different sizes (45–105 mm in shell length) were collected from the intertidal sites about 30 min after being submerged by the incoming tide for gut content analyses. Results of these analyses indicate that mussels consume a variety of phytoplankton, micro- and mesozooplankton, including mussel larvae and post-larvae. Cannibalism of juveniles of up to 620 μm was recorded for intertidal mussels, and conspecifics of up to 2.4 mm were found within the stomachs of additional mussels collected in August 2000 from a nearby subtidal site. For all three intertidal populations, mussel larvae and juveniles contribute about 70\% of the food particle consumption during the spawning peak in August, while phytoplankton and other zooplankton constitute the majority of the food source (about 99\%) in March, during gametogenesis. Larger intertidal mussels tended to have more food particles in their stomachs than smaller mussels within all three populations. Distinctive differences in food consumption among intertidal populations directly coincide with variations in total particulate matter (TPM), particulate organic matter (POM) and percent organic matter (OM) in the adjacent seawater. Separate experiments designed to test the feeding behavior of mussels feeding at different times during the incoming tide were conducted at one of the intertidal sites during August 2000 and March 2001. Results from these experiments indicate a marked shift in food consumption from bivalves to other mesozooplankton in August, and from phytoplankton to mesozooplankton in March. The observed combination of mussel predatory and grazing behavior over the incoming tide and through the year provides evidence for a strong food-web link between the benthic and pelagic life stages of this species. Furthermore, the high rate of cannibalism during some months of the year suggests that this source of food may significantly contribute to the energy budget of wild populations, with potential implications for evolutionary adaptive success.},

	abstract = {The endangered fan shell Pinna nobilis is a large bivalve mollusc ({\textless}120 cm shell length) endemic to the Mediterranean that lives one-third buried in soft substrata, generally in shallow coastal waters. We hypothesised that P. nobilis of different sizes would ingest different food sources, because small fan shells will inhale material from closer to the substratum than do large fan shells. We studied stomach contents and faeces of 18 fan shells, 6 small (mean 23.0 cm length), 6 medium-sized (mean 41.5 cm length) and 6 large (mean 62.7 cm length) living in a small area of a low-energy coastal detritic bottom characterised by mud, sand and macroalgae at Mali Ston Bay, Croatia. We found that all P. nobilis ingested copious quantities of undetermined detritus (probably at least 95\% of ingested material), phytoplankton, micro and mesozooplankton and pollen grains. Large P. nobilis stomach contents showed a preponderance of water column calanoid copepods, while small fan shells had higher numbers of bivalve larvae. All fan shells took in high numbers of harpacticoid copepods that are benthonic, feeding on microbial communities of detritus and benthic vegetation. There was also a significant selection of phytoplankton species, some apparently occurring between inhalation and ingestion. The stomach contents of small P. nobilis had a higher organic matter content than either medium-sized or large fan shells; this indicated that small fan shells ingested detritus of higher organic content than did larger P. nobilis. As the faeces of all P. nobilis had similar organic matter content, this also indicates higher assimilation efficiencies in small fan shells. The demonstration of differential dietary selectivity by different sized animals has implications for future trophic studies of this endangered species. This study also provides the first demonstration of predation on zooplankton by P. nobilis.},

Relative abundances of bacteria and nanoplanktonic protozoa (HNAN, primarily heterotrophic flagellates) are similar in marine and freshwater environments, which suggests analogous trophic relationships. Ranges of microbe abundances in marine and fresh waters overlap, and seasonal changes in abundances within an ecosystem are often as great as differences in abundances between freshwater and marine systems of similar productivities. Densities of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoplankton, therefore, are strongly related to the degree of eutrophication, and not salt per se. Data from the literature is compiled to demonstrate a remarkably consistent numerical relationship (ca 1000 bacteria: l HNAN) between bacterioplankton and HNAN from the euphotic zones of a variety of marine and freshwater systems. Based on the results of a simple food web model involving bacterial growth, bacterial removal by HNAN, predation on HNAN, and the observed relationships between bacterial and HNAN abundances in natural ecosystems, it is possible to demonstrate that bottom-up control (food supply) is more important in regulating bacteiial abundances in oligotrophic environments while top-down control (predation)is more important in eutrophic environments.},

Strong positive relationships were identified between 1) bacterial production and bacterial abundance and 2) bacterial production and algal biomass. The relationship between bacterial production and bacterial abundance was improved by also considering water temperature. The analysis of covariance model revealed consistent differences between fresh, marine and estuarine/coastal waters, with production consistently high in estuarine/coastal environments. The log-linear regression coefficient of abundance was not significantly different from 1.00, and this linear relationship permitted the use of specific growth rate (SGR in day−1) as a dependent variable. A strong relationship was identified between specific growth rate and temperature. This relationship differed slightly across the three habitats. A substantial portion of the residual variation from this relationship was accounted for by algal biomass, including the difference between marine and estuarine/coastal habitats. A small but significant difference between the fresh- and saltwater habitats remained. No significant difference between the chlorophyll effect in different habitats was identified. The model of SGR against temperature and chlorophyll was much weaker for freshwater than for marine environments. For a small subset of the data set, mean cell volume accounted for some of the residual variation in SGR. Pronounced seasonality, fluctuations in nutrient quality, and variation of the grazing environment may contribute to the unexplained variation in specific growth.},

The picoplankton distribution was greatly influenced by the hydrographic conditions prevailing in the southern Adriatic because of the influence of the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) and East Adriatic Current (EAC) forcing. Heterotrophic bacteria numerically dominated the picoplankton community through the entire transect with no significant accumulation. By contrast, picophytoplankton accumulated in the 50–75m layer, forming a pronounced deep chlorophyll maximum. Synechococcus dominated the photosynthetic picoplankton, whereas picoeukaryotes were the least abundant. The intrusion of warm LIW observed in the layer between 100 and 350m was followed by Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus peaks (10×103cellsmL−1 and 90×103cellsmL−1, respectively), as well as by the appearance of two Synechococcus ecotypes. Most picoeukaryotes were observed at the offshore stations, where geostrophic current calculation revealed the strongest EAC influence. A strong EAC spread over the central and eastern basin created a barrier for Prochlorococcus, whereas the picoeukaryote maxima coincided with the core of the EAC, suggesting its persistence to hydrological instabilities.},

The surface assemblage was represented by Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, while the bottom assemblage was made up of Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. As SAR11 was more dominant in the bottom layer, its appearance may be linked to northward transport of oligotrophic waters of higher salinity from the south. Gammaproteobacteria appeared only in the surface layer during summer, influenced by higher amounts of nutrients, brought in by the Po River. Synechococcus was the most abundant taxon at the genus level. Dominance of Synechococcus during the whole season agrees with its dominance in terms of abundance determined by flow cytometry, and confirms its utmost importance in the picoplankton community of this area.

The shell of the bivalve larvae offered no protection against digestive processes, resulting in high larval mortality once inside the stomach. Stomach content analysis (September 2001–January 2003) showed that bivalve larvae were ingested by farmed mussels year-round, with the exception of March 2002. Numbers of ingested larvae were highest in October 2001 and May 2002, which coincides with known spawning times of farmed mussels in Ireland. Mussels ingested a large size-range of bivalve larvae, suggesting that all stages of the bivalve life cycle are vulnerable to predation. It is suggested that adult bivalves routinely filter larvae from the surrounding water and that, given the high biomass of mussels present in mussel farms, filtration by adult bivalves significantly reduces numbers of bivalve larvae in nearby waters.},

Yet stable isotopes have not been applied to quantitatively characterize community-wide aspects of trophic structure (i.e., at the level of an entire food web). We propose quantitative metrics that can be used to this end, drawing on similar approaches from ecomorphology research. For example, the convex hull area occupied by species in δ13C–δ15N niche space is a representation of the total extent of trophic diversity within a food web, whereas mean nearest neighbor distance among all species pairs is a measure of species packing within trophic niche space. To facilitate discussion of opportunities and limitations of the metrics, we provide empirical and conceptual examples drawn from Bahamian tidal creek food webs. These examples illustrate how this methodology can be used to quantify trophic diversity and trophic redundancy in food webs, as well as to link individual species to characteristics of the food web in which they are embedded. Building from extensive applications of stable isotope ratios by ecologists, the community-wide metrics may provide a new perspective on food web structure, function, and dynamics.},

Analyses included two cultured species: Mytilus galloprovincialis and Ostrea edulis, and two naturally occurring species: Modiolus barbatus and Arca noae. Total lipid concentrations were higher in the digestive gland than in the adductor muscle in all species studied. The study confirmed seasonal variability of stable isotope signatures. Observed seasonal changes were more pronounced in the digestive gland than in the adductor muscle, suggesting that the former better reflects seasonal trophic patterns. The results obtained indicate isotopic niche overlap in the investigated species with the highest degree of overlap ( 60\%) among two cultured species during the spring–summer period, and between two naturally occurring species during the autumn–winter period ( 60\%). A lower degree of overlap between other species might suggest utilization of different additional food sources during certain times of the year.

severely depleted state in the wild. In order to address and potentially to
reverse this situation Ostrea edulis was designated as a named species in the UK
Biodiversity Action Plan as part of a national commitment to the
International Convention on Biodiversity. Amongst other initiatives, some of
which are summarised in this paper, a feasibility study was carried out to
evaluate all the factors, including an economic assessment, relevant to a
programme of stock restoration in the UK. The study showed that there is a
considerable body of data on the biology, ecology and distribution of O. edulis to
inform restoration projects. Appropriate legislation is in place to allow
for restoration. Non-marketable costs and benefits were estimated. They
provide an idea of the high value that may be placed on biodiversity
aspects. Nevertheless, this study also shows that stock restoration can be
commercially viable if fishery prices and yields are sufficiently high.
Restoration efforts and associated studies elsewhere have shown the
potential for success of native oyster stock regeneration, especially in
disease-free areas. For these, there is a very strong element of re-creating
and conserving an ecological resource. The relaying of cultch is seen as an
essential component of a successful oyster restoration programme and the use
of sanctuaries is generally considered beneficial. The loss of the standing
stock is a limiting factor and re-stocking is an effective strategy. There
is a basic genetic similarity of wild European O. edulis populations such that the
source of stocks is not critical. There are some problems with hatchery
rearing from these, but using breeding ponds or importing part-grown oysters
are viable alternatives.},

The development of a bonamiosis-resistant strain seems a promising strategy to fight against the disease. As a first step, evaluation of variability in productive traits and disease susceptibility of European populations was performed to identify favourable oyster populations with which to start selective breeding in Galicia (NW Spain). Oysters taken from Greece, Ireland, Ortigueira (Galicia) and Coroso (Galicia) were used as brood stock, and 19 seed families were produced (4–5 families from each origin). The oyster families were used to assess variability through on-growing in an area of the Ría de Arousa heavily affected by bonamiosis. Results showed significant differences in growth, mortality and susceptibility to bonamiosis and other diseases, both between origins and between families under origins. Bonamiosis was associated with mortality in the late stage of oyster on-growing. Indications of natural selection of bonamiosis less-susceptible oysters due to the long exposure of the Ortigueira population to bonamiosis were found. Other symbionts and pathological conditions were detected, of which herpes-like viral infections and disseminated neoplasia could also cause mortality. An index of the overall incidence of pathological conditions (OIPC) was estimated for each family. A significant correlation between the OIPC and the cumulative mortality of the families was noted. On average, oysters from autochthonous origins showed better performance. The results obtained with the best-performing families suggest that the profitability of oyster farming in Galicia would improve, even under bonamiosis pressure, by using appropriate oyster spat.},

	abstract = {The European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) is a highly appreciated mollusk with an important aquaculture production throughout the 20th century, in addition to playing an important role on coastal ecosystems. Overexploitation of natural beds, habitat degradation, introduction of non‐native species, and epidemic outbreaks have severely affected this important resource, particularly, the protozoan parasite Bonamia ostreae, which is the main concern affecting its production and conservation. In order to identify genomic regions and markers potentially associated with bonamiosis resistance, six oyster beds distributed throughout the European Atlantic coast were sampled. Three of them have been exposed to this parasite since the early 1980s and showed some degree of innate resistance (long‐term affected group, LTA), while the other three were free of B. ostreae at least until sampling date (naïve group, NV). A total of 14,065 SNPs were analyzed, including 37 markers from candidate genes and 14,028 from a medium‐density SNP array. Gene diversity was similar between LTA and NV groups suggesting no genetic erosion due to long‐term exposure to the parasite, and three population clusters were detected using the whole dataset. Tests for divergent selection between NV and LTA groups detected the presence of a very consistent set of 22 markers, located within a putative single genomic region, which suggests the presence of a major quantitative trait locus associated with B. ostreae resistance. Moreover, 324 outlier loci associated with factors other than bonamiosis were identified allowing fully discrimination of all the oyster beds. A practical tool which included the 84 highest discriminative markers for tracing O. edulis populations was developed and tested with empirical data. Results reported herein could assist the production of stocks with improved resistance to bonamiosis and facilitate the management of oyster beds for recovery production and ecosystem services provided by this species.},

	abstract = {The native European flat oyster Ostrea edulis is listed in the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (species and habitat protection) and in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Once extremely abundant in the nineteenth century, European stocks of O. edulis have declined during the twentieth century to rare, small, localised populations due to overexploitation, habitat degradation and, most recently, the parasitic disease bonamiosis. Selective breeding programmes for resistance to bonamiosis have been initiated in France and Ireland. High genetic diversity and bonamiosis-resistance would be important features of any sustainable restoration programmes for O. edulis. Oysters were sampled across Europe from four hatchery sources, four pond-cultured sources and four wild, but managed fisheries and were genotyped at five microsatellite loci. Hatchery-produced populations from small numbers of broodstock showed a significant loss of genetic diversity relative to wild populations and pedigree reconstruction revealed that they were each composed of a single large full-sib family and several small full-sib families. This extremely low effective population size highlights the variance in reproductive success among the potential breeders. Pond-cultured oysters were intermediate in genetic diversity and effective population size between hatchery and wild populations. Controlled hatchery production allows the development of bonamiosis-resistant strains, but at the expense of genetic diversity. Large scale pond culture on the other hand can provide a good level of genetic diversity. A mixture of these two approaches is required to ensure a healthy and sustainable restoration programme for O. edulis in Europe.},

Understanding the settlement behaviour of O. edulis larvae is crucial to inform these strategies. We compared the efficiency of several treatments in triggering settlement. The most effective settlement occurred with the presence of conspecifics: 100\% settled in {\textless}23 h. Marine stones with habitat-associated biofilms induced 81\% settlement that started after a 45 h delay. Sterile shells and terrestrial stones did not induce more settlement than control treatments. These results indicate that O. edulis larvae are gregarious and finely-tuned to settle in response to cues which are indicative of their adult habitat requirements. The role of chemical cues in mediating settlement, and the importance of this to restoration, are discussed.},

A selective breeding programme commenced in 1988 by Atlantic Shellfish Ltd. to produce B. ostreae-resistant oysters using 3 to 4 yr old survivors as broodstock for controlled spawning in land-based spatting ponds. On-growing of oyster spat settled on mussel cultch was carried out on designated beds within Cork Harbour. Oyster production subsequently increased successfully, resulting in 3 yr old Rossmore O. edulis being marketed from 1993 onwards and a record tonnage of 4 yr old oysters being produced in 1995 and 1996. O. edulis production, B. ostreae prevalence and oyster mortalities have been monitored and recorded at Rossmore for over 30 yr. The collation and analysis of this data from 52 samples and 3190 oysters demonstrate the introduction and progression of bonamiosis and subsequent interventions to ameliorate disease effects during this period at Rossmore. Results suggest that O. edulis mortalities are now negligible during the first 4 yr of growth, prevalence of B. ostreae infection is low, and no correlation exists between prevalence of infection and oyster mortalities. This study, when compared to other studies of bonamiosis-infected oyster populations, suggests that an intervention in the form of a selective breeding programme is required to reduce the impact of the disease.},

	abstract = {The Scientific Advisory Committee on Fisheries (SAC) of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) held its twentieth session in Tangiers, Morocco, from 26 to 29 June 2018. The session was attended by delegates from 14 Mediterranean contracting parties, seven observers, representatives of the FAO regional projects, the GFCM Secretariat and invited experts. The Committee reviewed the work carried out during the 2017–2018 intersession, including within its four subregional subsidiary bodies (Subregional Committee for the Adriatic Sea, Subregional Committee for the Central Mediterranean, Subregional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean and Subregional Committee for the Western Mediterranean) which all met during the intersession. In relation to the mid-term strategy (2017–2020) towards the sustainability of Mediterranean and Black Sea fisheries, the Committee welcomed the progress in multiple priority activities as well as cooperation with partners. Issues in relation to fishery data quality, data collection needs and methodologies, estimation and quantification of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and formulation of advice on the status of fisheries were discussed. Recalling the need to improve knowledge on small-scale fisheries in the the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, the work underway to test a characterization matrix as well as the forthcoming Regional Plan of Action for Small-Scale Fisheries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea were tackled. Furthermore, the Committee formulated advice on the following aspects: i) overall status of Mediterranean stocks; ii) management of European eel; iii) management of deep-sea fisheries and identification of VMEs and iv) roadmap towards a network of essential fish habitats. In line with the subregional approach and based on the conclusions of the four subregional committees, the SAC also provided specific advice for each subregion. In particular, attention was paid to: i) blackspot seabream in the western Mediterranean; ii) demersal fisheries in the Strait of Sicily; iii) small pelagic fisheries in the Adriatic Sea; iv) demersal fisheries in the Adriatic Sea, including the monitoring of the Jabuka/Pomo Pit fisheries restricted area; and v) deep-water red shrimps in the central and eastern Mediterranean. In addition, the Committee also endorsed un updated table of priority species by subregion. Finally, the Committee agreed upon its work plan for 2018–2020 and elected its new Bureau.},

	abstract = {The response of the Adriatic Sea to bora wind forcing in stratified conditions is analyzed using a baroclinic multilayer model. The model is linearized in the momentum equations and fully nonlinear in the thermodynamic equations. The model was forced with an idealized wind field having horizontal shear and also convergence. The alongshore shear is approximated by a harmonic function of the alongshore distance with an 80-km space scale, and a maximum corresponding to a moderate wind of 3 dyn cm(-2). Idealized initial temperature and salinity vertical profiles similar to an autumn situation are assumed. The model was integrated for five days, presumably a duration of a more persistent bora event. Due to strong shear in the bora wind field the sea level is characterized by a series of highs and lows distributed along the longitudinal axis of the Adriatic. The highest positive sea level departures are observed at the northernmost corner of the Adriatic near Venice associated with the wind setup. The strongest upwelling occurs along the northern portion of the Albanian coast where the bora wind has a nonzero alongshore component. The average current field on the fifth day shows a vertical distribution suggesting Ekman dynamics. The current component perpendicular to the coast in the surface layer is oriented in an offshore direction, which then results in a coastal upwelling, especially along the Albanian coast. The alongshore surface velocity component along that portion of the Adriatic coast is in the direction opposite to that associated with the coastal upwelling. Current reversal takes place at a depth of about 30 m, which coincides with the estimated depth of the surface Ekman layer. The model results thus show that at intermediate depths (below the Ekman layer depth) the bora wind weakens the inflowing branch of the Adriatic residual cyclonic circulation (along the eastern shore) and intensifies the return flow along the western shelf break. Therefore, the bora reduces the Levantine Intermediate Water inflow and probably causes its occasional blocking or even complete current reversals. The period of the geostrophic adjustment is characterized by strong inertial oscillations that die down quickly in the coastal boundary layer and persist for the entire period of simulation outside of it. The mean kinetic energy density is higher at the upwelling than at the downwelling coast of the Adriatic. For illustration of numerical results, a satellite infrared image is presented of one situation in the Adriatic Sea characterized by a strong bora wind forcing.},

Bacterial biomass ranged from 5.28 to 21.20 μg C l-1. Increased values were present during warmer seasons with the domination of low nucleic acid (LNA) group of bacteria. The high nucleic acid (HNA) bacterial group dominated during the winter and the spring. Bacterial production ranged from 0.09 -0.45 × 104 cells ml-1 h-1 .At coastal stations increased production was present during the winter and the spring and was more or less uniform at open sea stations. Biomasses of Syn and Prochl ranged from 0.16 to 11.47 µg C-1 l-1 and from 0.01 to 3.08 µg C l-1, respectively. They were elevated during the summer and the autumn at coastal stations and during the late winter at the open sea. Syn biomass always dominated over Prochl participating with 61.6-97.2\% in biomass of cyanobacteria. Biomass of picoeukaryotes ranged from 1.21 to 21.85 µg C l-1 and was the highest during the winter. Their biomass notably prevailed in autotrophic picoplankton (APP) biomass over that of picocyanobacteria during the whole year. Autotrophic components (Prochl, Syn and picoeukaryotes) made greater contribution to the picoplankton biomass in mesotrophic and eutrophic areas, while heterotrophic bacteria became more important under oligotrophic conditions.},

	volume = {102},
	abstract = {Background and purpose: Migration of the sardine Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) in the northern Adriatic Sea in relation to hydrographic properties of seawater was described. It was observed that seasonal changes in hydrographic properties of seawater (temperature and salinity) could be  related to  migration pattern of  sardine subpopulation in  the  northern Adriatic Sea. Those changes in properties of marine environment probably have an indirect influence on  sardine northward (trophic) migration, but  a  direct  influence on  southward migration. Due to fact that in the last 25 years were not published any data on this issue, the objective of this paper is to described sardine migrations in the northern Adriatic Sea, at the same time regarding to the changes in its environment. Material and methods: Hydrographic data used in this paper were collected at five stations in the northern Adriatic sea and one situated in Kvarner Bay. Fleet of commercial mid-water trawlers (10 fishing vessels), searching for the highest concentration of fish schools using echo sounder and sonar (with aim to obtain the biggest possible catch), were used to collect information about the position of the bulk of sardine subpopulation in the northern Adriatic for each month. The information about migrations of the sardine were collected directly on board, 4-5 times a month, in the period from 1995 to 1997. Results and conclusions: During the spawning season, sardine searched for areas with the highest temperature and  salinity values as  well  as  stabile environmental conditions. After spawning, sardine migrated toward the most productive feeding areas.

The short Po River pulses in August result in the surface advection ofriverine water, nutrients and phytoplankton from the western to the easternside of the Adriatic. This surface spreading exhibits inter-annual variabilitydepending on the riverine discharge in the preceding period. The Po Riverdischarge pulse in August 2010 in particular resulted in an extraordinary ton-gue-like advection of riverine water, nutrients, and phytoplankton towards theEastern Adriatic coast. The phenomenon was detected using both satelliteimagery and classical oceanographic measurements. In the advective water,toxic dinoflagellates were most abundant in August 2010, when the influenceof the Po was greatest

To this day, over 55 years of monthly measurements through the photic zone have been accumulated, including close to 3000 production measurements at different depths. The measurements are conducted over a six-hour period around noon, and the average production rate extrapolated linearly over day length to calculate daily production. Here, a non-linear primary production model is used to correct these estimates for potential overestimation of daily production due to linear extrapolation. The assimilation numbers are recovered from the measured production profiles and subsequently used to model production at depth. Using the recovered parameters, the model explained 87\% of variability in measured normalized production at depth. The model is then used to calculate daily production at depth, and it is observed to give on average 20\% lower daily production at depth than the estimates based on linear extrapolation. Subsequently, water column production is calculated, and here, the model predicted on average 26\% lower water column production. With the recovered parameters and the known magnitude of the overestimation, the time-series of water column production is then re-established with the non-linearly-corrected data. During this 55-year period, distinct regimes were observed, which were classified with a regime shift detection method. It is then demonstrated how the recovered parameters can be used in a remote sensing application. A seasonal cycle of the recovered assimilation number is constructed along with the seasonal cycle of remotely-sensed chlorophyll. The two are then used to model the seasonal cycle of water column production. An upper and a lower bound on the seasonal cycle of water column production based on remotely-sensed chlorophyll data are then presented. Measured water column production was found to be well within the range of remotely-sensed estimates. With this work, the utility of in situ measurements as a means of providing information on the assimilation number is presented and its application as a reference for remote sensing models highlighted.},

	abstract = {Status assessment of exploited fish populations is a general requirement to ensure sustainability of fisheries in
both global and local contexts. The blue jack mackerel Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich, 1825) remains unassessed
in a data-limited fishery in the eastern central Atlantic, within the waters of the Canary Islands (Spain) off the coast of
northwest Africa. This is the most southwestern targeted fishery in the species’ distributional range. To obtain basic
life-history information, a total of 2 472 specimens were analysed, ranging from 10.2 to 31.9 cm total length, from
samples collected monthly between March 2005 and March 2006. Length–weight relationships (a = 0.0023; b = 3.418;
R2 = 0.97) showed no significant difference between sexes. Deposition periodicity and coherence of the ageing criteria
were verified by analysis of the monthly evolution of the otolith edge. Ages were estimated by counting annual growth
rings on whole otoliths, with these fish ranging from age 0 to 6 years. The von Bertalanffy growth model, which was
used to estimate growth parameters from both direct readings and back-calculated length-at-age data, gave good
statistical fits. The parameters from the direct readings were: L∞ = 34.9 cm; k = 0.214 y–1; t0 = −2.545 y (R2 = 0.84), and
the natural mortality rates estimated from empirical methods varied between 0.20 and 0.55 y–1.},

climate and regional-scale Adriatic hydroclimate changes significantly reflected in the Adriatic
Sea ecosystem. To clarify this statement we set up in connection two inter-annual systems: the airsea
interconnected system and pelagic ecosystems for the period 1961 to 2010. Within this period,
significant changes occurred through 1987-1998 period, characterized by a drop of temperature,
salinity and oxygen concentration in the middle Adriatic intermediate layer as consequence of
a weaker ventilation of the Adriatic Sea. The pelagic ecosystem reacted to these changes. Large
fluctuations in marine biota (from plankton to pelagic fish) revealed significantly different regimes
before and after the late eighties. Different patterns observed through analyzed biotic parameters
seem linked to modification in thermohaline circulation related to the Eastern Mediterranean
Transient (EMT), whose effects prevented warmer and saltier water mass intrusions into the Adriatic
Sea. These results provide evidence on connections between the shifts in the middle Adriatic pelagic
ecosystem and the northern hemisphere climate via changes in regional atmospheric conditions,
and highlight the importance of northern hemisphere climate changes for physical and biological

monthly evolution of the gonado-somatic index and the proportion of mature individuals, the spawning season occurred
between January and April, peaking in February. Lengths at
first maturity (LFM) were calculated from the maturity
ogives by the Gompertz model for all specimens (22.79 cm),
for males (21.20 cm) and for females (23.05 cm). In this area
the minimum legal size for T. picturatus is actually smaller
than the length at first maturity and should be revised to
avoid depletion of the stock.},

Monte Carlo sampler to sample trees and model parameter values from their joint posterior distribution. All statistical
inferences are naturally based on this sample. The sample provides a most-probable tree with posterior probabilities
for each clade, information that is qualitatively similar to that for the maximum-likelihood tree with bootstrap
proportions and permits further inferences on tree topology, branch lengths, and model parameter values. On moderately large trees, the computational advantage of our method over bootstrapping a maximum-likelihood analysis
can be considerable. In an example with 31 taxa, the time expended by our software is orders of magnitude less
than that a widely used phylogeny package for bootstrapping maximum likelihood estimation would require to
achieve comparable statistical accuracy. While there has been substantial debate over the proper interpretation of
bootstrap proportions, Bayesian posterior probabilities clearly and directly quantify uncertainty in questions of
biological interest, at least from a Bayesian perspective. Because our tree proposal algorithms are independent of
the choice of likelihood function, they could also be used in conjunction with likelihood models more complex
than those we have currently implemented.},

Euphausiacea constituted the most important food resource by weight, number and frequency occurrence. Teleosts were the second most important food category, while mysids, decapods and cephalopods were occasional food. There was little seasonal variation in diet. Euphausiids were dominant prey during all seasons, and were especially abundant from spring and autumn. Feeding intensity of horse mackerel varied during the year. The lowest intensity of feeding was recorded in winter (February, March) and early spring (April) during the lower sea temperature as well as at the time of intensive spawning. Feeding activity increased upon spawning period (May and June) and was also higher during summer. Feeding intensity and diet composition changed during the diurnal cycle. The highest feeding intensity was recorded at night and during early morning hours. Euphausiids, mysids and a greater part of teleosts dominated night and morning diet, while decapods and cephalopods were most frequently in the daily and evening diet.},

Anchovy (10 to 130 mm total length) were collected during a 1 wk cruise in October 2002. Feeding activity was mainly diurnal in all the length classes: stomach fullness, calculated for each 10 mm size class, was always higher during the day than at night, with maximal values measured for the 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 mm size classes. All analysed life stages of \textit{E. encrasicolus} had a strictly zooplanktivorous diet based on a few species of copepods. The principal prey of \textit{E. encrasicolus} were small-sized copepods, measuring about 0.2 to 0.3 or 0.5 to 0.6 mm in prosoma length. The copepods \textit{Euterpina acutifrons} and \textit{Oncaea} spp. dominated anchovy diet during the day, both in terms of frequency, number and biomass, in all anchovy size classes. During the night, bivalve larvae were also important dietary items, with \textit{Oncaea} spp. and \textit{E. acutifrons} making up {\textgreater}69\% of total prey number for all anchovy size classes. Within the considered size range, the dimensions of particles does not seem to be a limiting factor in food selection, and no relationship was found between anchovy length and the maximal dimension of ingested prey. Ivlev’s electivity index confirmed that European anchovy was able to select specific food items and preferred small copepods such as \textit{E. acutifrons} and \textit{Oncaea} spp., and bivalve and decapod larvae.},

It is an important predator of deep upper shelf slope communities currently characterized by growth overexploitation: the understanding of hake's diet might support next generation management tools. However, all current European hake diet studies depend on the morphological identification of prey remains in stomach content, with consequent limitations. In this study, we set up a metabarcoding approach based on cytochrome oxidase I PCR amplification and Miseq Illumina paired-end sequencing of M. merluccius stomach content remains and compared the results to classic morphological analyses. A total of 95 stomach contents of M. merluccius sampled in the North-Central Adriatic Sea were analyzed with both the metabarcoding and morphological approaches. Metabarcoding clearly outperformed the morphological method in the taxonomic identification of prey describing more complex trophic relationships even when considering the morphological identification of 200 stomach contents. Statistical analysis of diet composition revealed a weak differentiation among the hake's size classes, confirming an opportunistic feeding behavior. All the analyses performed showed the presence of a core of shared prey among the size classes and a cloud of size-specific prey. Our study highlights the exceptional potential of metabarcoding as an approach to provide unprecedented taxonomic resolution in the diet of M. merluccius and potentially of other marine predators, due to the broad-spectrum of detection of the primers used. A thorough description of these complex trophic relationships is fundamental for the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries.},

Ecology, 78, 1271–1276, 1998) identified four major areas requiring further research in experimental animal isotopic ecology: (i) the dynamics of isotopic incorporation, (ii) mixing models, (iii) the problem of routing, and (iv) trophic discrimination factors. 2 Differences in isotopic incorporation rates among tissues seem to be explained by variation in protein turnover. The application of multi-compartment models to isotopic incorporation data has revealed that different inferences can be derived between these and one-compartment models. 3 A variety of mixing models of varying degrees of complexity and realism are used to find the contribution of isotopic sources to the elements in an organism's tissues. The use of these models demands the use of tissue to diet discrimination factors that are rarely measured experimentally. 4 Mixing models assume that assimilated nutrients are disassembled into their elemental components and that these elements are reassembled into biomolecules. This assumption is unrealistic as macromolecules are routed differentially into tissues. Isotopic routing is an area that isotopic ecologists have neglected in their experimental and modelling research. 5 Isotopic ecologists are just beginning to understand why 15N biomagnifies along trophic chains, and to explore the factors that determine the degree of 15N biomagnification. We review the hypotheses that explain why 15N biomagnifies up trophic chains. 6 The use of compound-specific isotopic analyses is opening new fruitful areas of research at the intersection of nutritional and isotopic ecology.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Although conceptually robust, it has proven difficult to find practical measures of niche width that are simple to obtain, yet provide an adequate descriptor of the ecological position of the population examined. 2 Trophic niche has proven more tractable than other niche dimensions. However, indices used as a proxy for trophic niche width often suffer from the following difficulties. Such indices rarely lie along a single scale making comparisons between populations or species difficult; have difficulty in combining dietary prey diversity and evenness in an ecologically meaningful way; and fail to integrate diet over ecological time-scales thus usually only comprise single snapshots of niche width. 3 We propose an alternative novel method for the comparison of trophic niche width: the use of variance of tissue stable isotope ratios, especially those of nitrogen and carbon. 4 This approach is a potentially powerful method of measuring trophic niche width, particularly if combined with conventional approaches, because: it provides a single measure on a continuous axis that is common to all species; it integrates information on only assimilated prey over time; the integration period changes with choice of tissue sampled; and data production is theoretically fast and testing among populations simple. 5 Empirical studies are now required to test the benefits of using isotopic variance as a measure of niche width, and in doing so help refine this approach.},

synthesis of the complex structure and function of a real marine food web, based on analyses of body size distributions, production-body size relationships and trophic level-body size relationships. We show how size-based estimates of production, species
richness and trophic level (from nitrogen stable isotope analysis) can be used to quantify trophic transfer efficiency, mean predator-prey body-mass ratios and the mean ratio of the number of predator to prey species in marine food webs. We applied these
methods to the central North Sea, and estimated transfer efficiencies of 3.7 to 12.4\%, a mean predator-prey body-mass ratio of 109:1 and a mean ratio of the number of predator to prey species of 0.34. We conducted sensitivity analyses to show how
differences in the fractionation of δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N and changes in the slope of the relationship between production and δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N affected our predictions. Our estimates of transfer efficiency
and mean predator-prey body-mass ratios are similar to those obtained by costly and labour-intensive diet- and ecosystem-modelling studies. Coupled analyses of size and trophic structure may provide a method for validating ecosystem models and assessing
human impacts on marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Body size determines rates of respiration and production, energy requirements, mortality rates, patterns of predation and vulnerability to mortality. Body size distributions are often used to describe structure and energy flux in communities and ecosystems. 2 If clear relationships can be established between body size and trophic level in fishes, they may provide a basis for integrating community and ecosystem analyses based on size spectra, food webs and life histories. 3 We investigated relationships between the body sizes (weight and length) of north-east Atlantic fishes and their trophic level. The abundance of 15N, as determined by stable isotope analysis, was used as an index of trophic level. 4 Cross-species and comparative analyses demonstrated that body size was unrelated or weakly related to trophic level. Thus allometric relationships between body size and trophic level could not be used to predict the trophic structure of fish communities. 5 The results of the cross-species analyses contrasted with patterns in the size and trophic structure of entire fish communities. When fish communities were divided into size classes, there were strong positive relationships between size class and trophic level. The slope suggested a mean predator : prey body mass ratio of 80 : 1. 6 Our results suggest that body size does not provide a useful surrogate of trophic level for individual species, but that body size is an excellent predictor of trophic level within the community, providing an empirical basis for integrating community analyses based on models of trophic structure and body size distributions.},

	abstract = {The structure of the pelagic foodweb in the upwelling ecosystem of Galicia (NW Spain) was studied by means of the enrichment in 13 C and 15 N isotopes in plankton (four size classes from 20 to \&gt;1000 μm), sardine (primary consumer) and dolphin (top consumer). Samples were collected in March 1998, during the spawning period of sardines at the beginning of the upwelling season. Isotopic enrichment across plankton size classes was lower than either enrichment between plankton and sardine or enrichment between sardine and dolphin. This difference may be attributed to the presence of chain-forming phytoplankton in some plankton size classes but also to a large degree of omnivory among zooplankton. Also, there was a size-dependent effect on 15 N enrichment of sardine. Sardines \&lt;18 cm had a variable isotopic enrichment but generally higher than those of larger sardines, revealing omnivorous but mostly zoophagous diets. In contrast, sardines ≥18 cm showed a linear decrease of 15 N enrichment with length, as a consequence of the increase in the efficiency of filter-feeding and in the amount of phytoplankton ingested. According to 15 N enrichment, we concluded that probably there are no more than four trophic levels in the studied ecosystem. Nevertheless, our results revealed that the pelagic food web in this upwelling area is more complex than expected due to the generalized omnivory in all organisms. Furthermore, the obtained relationships between δ 15 N and the size of organisms provide the basis for a quantitative analysis of changes in the trophic structure of this ecosystem.},

Variation in δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N over the course of the seasonal production cycle was significantly greater in smaller animals and declined continuously with increasing body size. The duration and magnitude of a decrease in δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N (as observed in the zooplankton community at the start of the production cycle) was reduced and attenuated in larger animals at higher trophic levels (higher mean δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N), likely reflecting different rates of energy propagation in different food web pathways and the transfer of energy to animals with slower turnover times. Animals ≥16 g wet body mass integrated seasonal variation in δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N of their prey, such that a single annual sampling of animals in size classes ≥16 g was sufficient to determine mean δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N. For zooplankton and smaller infauna, very frequent sampling would be required to estimate mean δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N, and we show that measurements of food web properties such as trophic position and predator-prey size ratios would be biased when based on single samples of these small animals.},

In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.},

	abstract = {The NW Mediterranean has a number of structural features in common with upwelling ecosystems. Therefore, an ecological model representing a NW Mediterranean exploited ecosystem was standardized and compared with four previously standardized models from coastal upwelling ecosystems: the Northern and Southern Humboldt (Chile and Peru upwelling systems) and the Northern and Southern Benguela (Namibia and South Africa upwelling systems). Results from biomasses, flows and trophic levels indicated important differences between ecosystems, mainly caused by differences in primary production, which was smallest in the NW Mediterranean Sea. However, principal component analysis (PCA) of biomasses and flows suggested a similar pattern between the NW Mediterranean and the South African systems due to the inclusion of an important fraction of the continental shelf in both ecological models representing these areas. At the same time, diets of commercial species from the NW Mediterranean were more similar to Benguela than Humboldt species. However, the relatively heavy fishing pressure in the NW Mediterranean ecosystem was highlighted relative to its primary production, and was evident from the large catches and small primary production, largest flows from TL 1 required to sustain the fishery (\%PPR), the low trophic level of the catch (TLc), high exploitation rates (F/Z), largest values in the trophic spectra portraying catch: biomass ratio, the FIB index and the demersal: total catch ration. Comparisons of \%PPR, the trophic level of the community (TLco), the biomass of consumers and F/Z ratios seemed to capture the ecosystem effects of fishing: large in the NW Mediterranean, Namibia and Peru upwelling systems. Small pelagic fish were the most important component of the fisheries in the NW Mediterranean and Peruvian systems. However, the smaller production and biomass ratios from the NW Mediterranean could be an indirect indicator of intense fishing pressure on small pelagic fish, also in line with results from consumption of small pelagic fish by the fishery, F/Z ratios and trophic spectra. Moreover, similarities between the NW Mediterranean and Namibian systems were found, mainly related to the demersal: total catch ratios, the FIB index, the relevance of gelatinous zooplankton in the consumption of production and the importance of pelagic-demersal coupling, in remarkable contrast to the other ecosystems. These similarities should be interpreted in terms of dynamic trajectories that the Namibian system has shown due to the collapse of its pelagic ecosystem, partly due to fishing intensity, and the signs that the NW Mediterranean could follow suit in the future.},

The importance of local adaptations in the trophic ecology of this species was estimated. Sardina pilchardus from the Atlantic Iberian coast and from the north-western Mediterranean Sea have clear differences in the feeding apparatus and diet compositions. Those from the Atlantic Iberian coast have significantly more GRs than S. pilchardus of the same size range in the Mediterranean Sea. While S. pilchardus from the Mediterranean Sea mostly depend on prey ranging between 750–1500 and 3000–4000 µm, corresponding mostly to cladocerans, decapods and copepods, those from the Atlantic depend on smaller prey (50–500 and 1000–1500 µm) that include phytoplankton and copepods, particularly during summer months, and S. pilchardus eggs during the winter. The marked difference between the trophic ecology of S. pilchardus in the two areas studied appears to have originated from different dietary strategies that the two populations have adopted in contrasting feeding environments. These differences are shown to profoundly affect the size and quality of prey consumed, and the effect of cannibalism on the populations.},

In the study period (summer) a clear geographical pattern was recognized in the isotopic composition of both species, with an increasing trend northward. The highest variations in isotopic signal were linked to the geographical positions of the samples and, especially, between pairs of areas: South Sicily/South Campania and Gulf of Gaeta/South Elba. Higher isotope values were found in the anchovies and sardines caught in northern Tyrrhenian Sea, while lower values were mostly estimated in the southern region. Higher carbon and nitrogen isotopes may reflect a more coastal behaviour of both species, being 13C-enriched source from benthic primary producers in addition to phytoplankton. Variations in the nitrogen isotope ratio may reflect not only differences in the trophic level of prey species, but also variations in the baseline level of food webs. Our results support the hypothesis that feeding behaviour of both species is directly or indirectly influenced by local factors, or by resource partitioning based on zooplankton size. Findings can supply knowledge needed for improving fish stock management and promoting plans able to take into account also local ecosystem analysis.},

The stomach contents of 1485 fish, including anchovy, sprat, and horse mackerel, were examined. Fish fed on 35 prey taxa, and there were dietary differences among predators. Anchovies predominantly consumed calanoid copepods and bivalves; sprats had a diet dominated by calanoid copepods and Chaetognatha (Parasagitta setosa); horse mackerel consumed mainly decapods and calanoid copepods. Copepods in the stomachs of sprat were more abundant and more frequent than in the stomachs of anchovy or horse mackerel during all year. As the anchovies and horse mackerel grew, their copepod consumption increased, but despite their size, sprats consumed a similar amount of copepods. Seasonal shifts in diet were observed in all three species. In winter and autumn months, all small pelagic fish consumed copepod species. The bivalve larvae were mostly consumed in summer by anchovies (N\%: 72.98) and in spring by sprats and horse mackerel (N\%: 88.59 and 81.08, respectively). Decapod species were preferred in spring months by horse mackerel. P. setosa was mostly consumed in autumn and winter by sprat. Anchovy showed a low dietary overlap with sprat but had a high dietary overlap with horse mackerel. The feeding strategy of anchovy seems to be mixed, while horse mackerel is a generalist at the individual level, and sprat is a specialist at the population level.},

	abstract = {The study of the feeding ecology of marine organisms is crucial to understanding their ecological roles and advancing our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning. The aim of this study was to analyse the trophic ecology of two demersal predator species, black anglerfish (Lophius budegassa) and white anglerfish (L. piscatorius), in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Both species are important in the study area due to their high abundance and economic value, but information about their feeding behaviour is scarce. Here, we described the diet composition and ecological role of these two species, investigating whether trophic segregation exists between them and amongst fish of different sizes. In addition, by using experimental survey data we described the spatial distribution of both species to help us interpret trophic behaviour patterns. We gathered samples of two different sizes (small individuals of a total length {\textless}30 cm and large individuals ≥30 cm) of both species and combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon with isotopic mixing models. Our results revealed that both anglerfish species are opportunistic predators, showing a diet composed mainly of fishes and, to a lesser extent, of crustaceans, with a small proportion of cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves and echinoderms. We found trophic segregation between the two species and the two sizes, indicating that they feed on different prey, in line with differences in their spatial distribution within the study area. This partial partition of food resources could also be explained by the differences in rhythms of activity that were reported in previous studies. In addition, although both species occupied a high position within the food web, our results showed that white anglerfish individuals and the large-sized fish of both species held higher trophic positions. This study demonstrates the usefulness of complementary approaches for trophic studies and confirms that both anglerfish species play an important role as predators in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea food web.},

Fullness indices fluctuated in relation to month and area of capture. Significantly greater quantities of food were found in the stomachs of specimens in the western part of the Gulf in September. Polychaetes were the primary food item in three of the five samplings. Bivalves, the second most important prey, showed great seasonal fluctuations. Crustaceans were third, while gastropods, echinoids and sipunculids, although occurring frequently in the stomachs, were of minor importance. There were differences in quantity and, to a lesser degree, quality between the diet of male and female red mullet, possibly related to sexual differences in growth rate. Cluster analysis revealed that the prey species composition in the stomachs of red mullet was influenced by area of capture rather than fish length. Possible relations of food availability to the migration pattern of the species are also discussed.},

A clear size-related shift in diet was observed in M. barbatus, with an increase in polychaete and shrimp consumption with size and a decrease in small crustacean consumption. In M. surmuletus, a diet shift was observed only between medium and large individuals. Large M. surmuletus preyed on shrimps, polychaetes, bivalves, ophiurids and amphipods, and ingested prey of lower mean mass than M. barbatus of similar size. Difference in size-related increase in δ15N between the two mullid fish species were related to difference of trophic level of their main prey. Sub-surface deposit-feeding polychaetes, carnivorous polychaetes, shrimps and brachyurans presented higher δ15N values than bivalves, small crustaceans and ophiurids. The lower δ13C values observed in M. barbatus compared to M. surmuletus were related to a higher consumption of sub-surface polychaetes in the former species. Significantly, lower δ13C were recorded in fishes collected off the Rhône River, particularly in spring, suggesting an influence of river inputs as a source of particular organic matter for mullids in this zone after the flooding season. Thus, these closely related sympatric fish species displayed diet divergences that were reflected in their stable isotopic signatures.},

	abstract = {Abstract European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is one of the most economically important fish for the Mediterranean Sea. It is an important predator of deep upper shelf slope communities currently characterized by growth overexploitation: the understanding of hake's diet might support next generation management tools. However, all current European hake diet studies depend on the morphological identification of prey remains in stomach content, with consequent limitations. In this study, we set up a metabarcoding approach based on cytochrome oxidase I PCR amplification and Miseq Illumina paired-end sequencing of M. merluccius stomach content remains and compared the results to classic morphological analyses. A total of 95 stomach contents of M. merluccius sampled in the North-Central Adriatic Sea were analyzed with both the metabarcoding and morphological approaches. Metabarcoding clearly outperformed the morphological method in the taxonomic identification of prey describing more complex trophic relationships even when considering the morphological identification of 200 stomach contents. Statistical analysis of diet composition revealed a weak differentiation among the hake's size classes, confirming an opportunistic feeding behavior. All the analyses performed showed the presence of a core of shared prey among the size classes and a cloud of size-specific prey. Our study highlights the exceptional potential of metabarcoding as an approach to provide unprecedented taxonomic resolution in the diet of M. merluccius and potentially of other marine predators, due to the broad-spectrum of detection of the primers used. A thorough description of these complex trophic relationships is fundamental for the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries.},

The size range of the population caught by both nets did not match exactly, since very small individuals ({\textless}5cm TL) were obtained only with the pelagic net, indicating that this part of the population had not present on the bottom. In addition, the 95.5\% of the pelagic captures were obtained during the night, while the maximum catches of the bottom net were obtained at midday, indicating that juvenile hake may display nocturnal vertical migration. Pronounced quantitative and qualitative variations in the diet of M. merluccius were observed between pelagic and bottom trawl samples belonging to the same size range. Differences in the stomach fullness and in the state of digestion of the food between benthic and pelagic individuals were also noticed.

	abstract = {Seasonal study of the diet and food consumption of juvenile hake has been carried out in the Central Mediterranean Sea (Southern Tyrrhenian Sea). Fish were the most important food resource in terms of weight (ca. 70\%). Among the fish, Myctophidae and Sternoptychidae, which are usually distributed deeper than juvenile hake, are most important. During summer, Ceratoscopelus maderensis constituted up to 21\% of weight of all prey, and Maurolicus muelleri represented almost 10\%. During autumn M. muelleri became the most important food resource. The way in which these more deeply distributed prey enter shallower food webs relates to the daily vertical migrations of lanternfish. In upper water column strata at night or near dawn they become prey of the juvenile hake. Considering that trophic energy flows primarily downward, in the direction of the productivity gradient, the observed flow of energy from deep strata into epipelagic layers could be considered an inverse energy transfer. Daily food consumption of juvenile hake ranged between 4.11 and 4.72\% of the body wet-weight (BWW). The application of a square-root model allowed calculation of the fraction of this consumption derived by ingestion of the more deeply distributed mesopelagic fish. Between 11.6\% and 17.8\% of food consumption was sustained by this energy flow. Such information is useful for understanding the interaction between communities distributed in different depth ranges and to reinforce the idea that marine communities are open systems in which migratory movements can dramatically change the assumptions and results of mass-balance models.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the ontogenetic diet change of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) in the north sector of the Strait of Sicily (SoS), central Mediterranean Sea. The species is one of the most important fish predators within the Mediterranean marine ecosystem and one of the main target species for local fisheries. A total of 2669 hake specimens between 7.5 and 67 cm of total length (TL) were collected in 2014–2015. The sample was divided into nine size classes and quantitative feeding indices were calculated for each size-class in order to analyse ontogenetic changes in prey preferences. Hierarchical cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) showed the occurrence of three main hake feeding guilds separated at 50\% similarity. Euphausiids and mysids dominated the diet of hake smaller than 14 cm TL and crustacean decapods and fish were the main prey of hake between 14.5 cm to 17.5 cm TL. A shift toward pelagic and necto-benthic fish occurred over 18 cm TL: hake between 18 and 32 cm TL prey mostly upon Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) whilst the silver scabbardfish (Lepidopus caudatus) was an important prey for hake over 32 cm TL. The study highlighted the key role played by the Atlantic horse mackerel for hake diet in the SoS, which is different to what has been previously observed in other Mediterranean areas where piscivorous hake feed substantially on small pelagic fish, such as anchovy and sardine. Information on hake diet composition, as provided in this study, can be integrated with data on consumption rate and population size to develop multispecies models leading to a quantitative understanding of the role of hake in the ecosystem.},

Samples were taken at 0.5, 10, and 20m, as well as near the bottom, using 5-l Niskin bottles. For inter-annual variation in the density of copepod assemblages data were presented as total number of nauplii and copepodites with adult copepods of the following groups: Calanoida, Cyclopoida-oithonids, Cyclopoida-oncaeids and Harpacticoida. Moreover, hydrographic conditions, both fractions of phytoplankton, non-loricate ciliates and tintinnids were taken into consideration. Nauplii are the most numerous fraction at both stations with an average over 74\% in the total number of all copepod groups. Their numbers were significantly higher at the western eutrophic station, while at the eastern oligotrophic station, an absolute maximum of 693 ind.l−1 was noted. The maximum values of calanoids and oithonids occur generally during summer and these copepods are always more numerous at the western station: 33–50\% and 50–63\%, respectively. The most abundant taxa identified were the calanoid Paracalanus parvus and the cyclopoid Oithona nana. Oncaeid species Oncaea waldemari and Monothula subtilis dominated during late autumn and winter. An atypical increase in the abundance of oncaeids during the summer of 1997 could be related to an invasion and mass occurrence of the calycophoran siphonophore Muggiaea atlantica. It can be concluded that these dominant copepods are responsible for the stabilization of very complex processes. Atypical appearances of major copepod groups and disturbances in the copepod population structure itself can significantly influence changes in the ecosystem of this very sensitive region.},

P. avirostrisoccurred from June to December, butreached its greatest abundance in the summer months.A significant correlation between the gut pigmentcontent and chlorophyll a concentration in thesurface layer was established. Observations with anepifluorescence microscope revealed that the guts werefilled with fluorescing nanoplankton and picoplankton(cyanobacteria). Quantitative estimates indicated thatP. avirostris grazed less than 5\% of theavailable chlorophyll a in more than half of allmeasurements, but removed most of the availablechlorophyll a in the surface layer during someperiods in September. It can therefore be concludedthat P. avirostris, together with planktonicprotists, plays an important role within the microbialloop.},

Temperature variations were limited to the upper 100m and salinity variations were small. Of previously known adult euphausiid species – 12 for the Adriatic (Gangai et al., 2012) and 13 for the Mediterranean (Mavidis et al., 2005) – calyptopes of 11 species of euphausiids were recorded. Abundance of calyptopes of all species was the highest in spring. Species were characterized according to their mean depth: surface (0–50m), sub-surface (50–200m), mesopelagic (200–800m), or bathypelagic (800–1200m) and vertical dispersion (scattered or non-scattered). Four diel patterns emerged: (i) nocturnal ascent to upper layers (Euphausia brevis, E. hemigibba, E. krohnii, Nematoscelis megalops, N. couchii), (ii) migration to upper layers at middle of the day and at night, and descent during the morning and evening (Stylocheiron maximum – only winter), (iii) weakly-migrating or non-migrating (S. longicorne), (iv) irregular migration independent of the day/night cycle (S. abbreviatum, S. maximum – during spring, summer and autumn, T. aequalis).},

In this context, oceanographic data and biological samples were collected in two different surveys, carried out during late June 2011 and early July 2015 in the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea). Differences in abundance, biomass, and assemblage structure of zooplankton and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus Linnaeus, 1758) population were observed between the two surveys. Still, zooplankton biomass was significantly correlated to longitude, chlorophyll a recorded during the surveys (as a proxy of primary production), and oxygen concentrations. Such differences affected the isotopic composition of anchovy, which showed changes in δ15N and δ13C values between the two surveys. Mixing models identified different contributions of food sources in the two sampling periods, i.e., major consumption on large copepods and euphausiids in 2015 with respect to 2011, which was consistent with a greater availability of these preys in the environment in 2015. The obtained results evidenced that E. encrasicolus may be affected by any environmental change that influences the plankton community, which is the basis of the diet of these fishes. Such findings highlighted the importance to further investigate the trophic relationships among different compartments of the food web, as well as the possible environmental influences, in order to obtain a more complete picture of ecosystem functioning and also in the light of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.},

Both lobster species were found to effectively clear water of food particles comprising nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina of about 600 μm in size. These were reduced to 50\% of the initial concentration within 5 h and to 90\% within 12 h. When N. norvegicus was offered food particles averaging 200 μm, a significant reduction in average size occurred, indicating that the minimum retention size is around 200 μm. Fluorescently dyed Artemia salina were recovered in the stomach and intestine of lobsters proving that the filtered particles are passed to the digestive tract. Results from other experiments, using the blood pigment (haemocyanin) concentration as an index of nutritional state, indicated that the lobsters can get some nutritional advantage from suspension feeding.

	abstract = {A dramatic decline has been recorded in Croatian shellfish production in recent years. Among the many factors that may have contributed to the decline of mussel production, i.e. EU import barriers and consequently small domestic market, great variability in larval dispersion and settlement, it is suspected that fish predation plays an important role in shellfish sustainability. Following this hypothesis, the abundance and diversity of fish assemblages around the Marina mussel farm, situated along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, was monitored for a two-year period, and the mussel recruitment losses, potentially driven from fish predation, after the ‘early thinning-out’ process was quantitatively evaluated by measuring the percentage of consumed or destroyed ropes of longlines. Overall, a total of sixteen fish taxa were recorded at the mussel farm, as opposed to fifteen taxa registered at all control locations. The asymmetrical design of the multivariate analyses revealed a statistically significant impact of the farm on fish assemblages, with expressed seasonal species variation. At mussel farm, the most abundant species observed were gilthead seabream Sparus aurata, sand smelt Atherina hepsetus and mullet Mugilidae species in summer and autumn; sand smelt A. hepsetus and bogue Boops boops in winter; and the sand smelt A. hepsetus, mullet Mugilidae species and seddled bream Oblada melanura in spring. At control locations, characterised with significantly lower fish assemblage abundances, the most abundant species were sand smelt A. hepsetus and mullet Mugilidae species in summer, sand smelt A. hepsetus and seddled bream O. melanura in autumn, sand smelt A. hepsetus and picarel Spicara flexuosa in winter, sand smelt A. hepsetus and bogue B. boops in spring. Gilthead sea bream was extremely abundant at mussel farm, with 5936 individuals censused in 155 of 192 fish counts (80\%), and a maximum abundance of 285 individuals per 5000m3. Stomach content analysis confirmed the presence of mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis as the dominant prey. During August (2009), monitoring of 423 ropes revealed that 276m of mussel ropes or approximately 828kg of mussels with an average shell length of 34.3±2.54mm were destroyed within the first week of mussel deposition into the sea. The recorded recruitment losses of 54\% in only one month of monitoring indicate a strong negative impact on farm management stability.},

It is now widely recognized that O. edulis is an integral component of a healthy biologically functional benthic environment and, as such, the restoration of wild stocks has become a matter of urgency. A major limiting factor in O. edulis stock recovery is the availability of suitable substrate material for oyster larvae settlement. This research re-examined the larval settlement potential of several naturally occurring in-situ shell materials (e.g. Mytilus edulis, Modiolus modiolus, O. edulis), with the aim of determining which shell material is the most appropriate for large-scale restoration projects. A positive correlation between available shell material and settlement was determined, and analysis using permanova did not identify an attachment preference by O. edulis to any particular shell type. The findings suggest that if restoration efforts were coordinated with applied hydrodynamic and habitat suitability modelling, in conjunction with naturally occurring shell substrate concentrations, a cost-effective recovery for O. edulis assemblages in the wild could be achieved.},

Fatty acid profiling of total lipids was used to examine these differences in diet in relation to shell size. Small (shell height 23.0 ± 3.3 cm), medium (SH 41.5 ± 5.5 cm) and large (SH 62.7 ± 4.8 cm) P. nobilis were collected from Mali Ston Bay, Adriatic Sea, in March 2010, and fatty acid analysis was performed on digestive gland and adductor muscle tissues. Based on the analysis of the digestive gland, small P. nobilis were associated with a detrital food chain, characterized by saturated and branched-chain fatty acids, while the diets of medium and large individuals had a greater proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This likely reflects the fact that smaller individuals feed within the benthic boundary layer where the detritus concentrations are high. Fatty acid incorporation into the adductor muscle, likely representative of food taken up over a longer time period, was reversed, that is, larger individuals had lower levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This most probably reflects energy expenditure, which typically increases with increasing organism size.},

In both seasons, the suspended mangrove detritus at the sediment–water interface was high as indicated by the mean percentage of even-numbered long-chain fatty acids in SM (12.8–18.4\%). The contribution of this marker in the clam tissues, especially during the cold season (3.9\%), indicates the consumption of mangrove detritus in considerable amounts by the clams. The occurrence of the fatty acids 16:1ω7, 18:1ω9, 18:2ω6 and 18:3ω3 in SM was most likely due to the mangrove detritus sources, whereas in the SM they together constituted 12.9\% and 23.9\% of total fatty acid contents during the cold and warm seasons, respectively. As a result, their contribution in the clam tissues was high in the cold (15.4\%) and warm seasons (19.0\%). These results indicate that mangrove detritus play a significant role in the clams' diet. The mean percentages of bacterial markers (odd-numbered branched fatty acids and vaccenic acid, 18:1ω7) in the SM and tissues during both seasons ranged from 8.1\% to 9.5\%. This indicates that the clam diet is also dependent on the attached bacteria on the partially decomposed leaf detritus suspended at the sediment–water interface. The relative contribution by microalgae markers (18:4ω3, 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3) in clam tissues ranged from 4.3\% to 7.6\%, suggesting considerable microalgae sources in the diets.},

Fisheries provide food and support livelihoods across the world. They are also under extreme pressure, with many stocks overfished and poorly managed. Climate change will add to the burden fish stocks bear, but such impacts remain largely unknown. Free et al. used temperature-specific models and hindcasting across fish stocks to determine the degree to which warming has, and will, affect fish species (see the Perspective by Plagányi). They found that an overall reduction in yield has occurred over the past 80 years. Furthermore, although some species are predicted to respond positively to warming waters, the majority will experience a negative impact on growth. As our world warms, responsible and active management of fisheries harvests will become even more important.

Climate change is altering habitats for marine fishes and invertebrates, but the net effect of these changes on potential food production is unknown. We used temperature-dependent population models to measure the influence of warming on the productivity of 235 populations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some populations responded significantly positively (n = 9 populations) and others responded significantly negatively (n = 19 populations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1\% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35\%. Outcomes of fisheries management—including long-term food provisioning—will be improved by accounting for changing productivity in a warmer ocean.
Climate influences on the world’s fish populations are explored.

We used a range of ecosystem models to explore the effects of fishing low–trophic level species on marine ecosystems, including marine mammals and seabirds, and on other commercially important species. In five well-studied ecosystems, we found that fishing these species at conventional maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels can have large impacts on other parts of the ecosystem, particularly when they constitute a high proportion of the biomass in the ecosystem or are highly connected in the food web. Halving exploitation rates would result in much lower impacts on marine ecosystems while still achieving 80\% of MSY.

	abstract = {IndiSeas (“Indicators for the Seas”) is a collaborative international working group that was established in 2005 to evaluate the status of exploited marine ecosystems using a suite of indicators in a comparative framework. An initial shortlist of seven ecological indicators was selected to quantify the effects of fishing on the broader ecosystem using several criteria (i.e., ecological meaning, sensitivity to fishing, data availability, management objectives and public awareness). The suite comprised: (i) the inverse coefficient of variation of total biomass of surveyed species, (ii) mean fish length in the surveyed community, (iii) mean maximum life span of surveyed fish species, (iv) proportion of predatory fish in the surveyed community, (v) proportion of under and moderately exploited stocks, (vi) total biomass of surveyed species, and (vii) mean trophic level of the landed catch. In line with the Nagoya Strategic Plan of the Convention on Biological Diversity (2011–2020), we extended this suite to emphasize the broader biodiversity and conservation risks in exploited marine ecosystems. We selected a subset of indicators from a list of empirically based candidate biodiversity indicators initially established based on ecological significance to complement the original IndiSeas indicators. The additional selected indicators were: (viii) mean intrinsic vulnerability index of the fish landed catch, (ix) proportion of non-declining exploited species in the surveyed community, (x) catch-based marine trophic index, and (xi) mean trophic level of the surveyed community. Despite the lack of data in some ecosystems, we also selected (xii) mean trophic level of the modelled community, and (xiii) proportion of discards in the fishery as extra indicators. These additional indicators were examined, along with the initial set of IndiSeas ecological indicators, to evaluate whether adding new biodiversity indicators provided useful additional information to refine our understanding of the status evaluation of 29 exploited marine ecosystems. We used state and trend analyses, and we performed correlation, redundancy and multivariate tests. Existing developments in ecosystem-based fisheries management have largely focused on exploited species. Our study, using mostly fisheries independent survey-based indicators, highlights that biodiversity and conservation-based indicators are complementary to ecological indicators of fishing pressure. Thus, they should be used to provide additional information to evaluate the overall impact of fishing on exploited marine ecosystems.},

Identifying and quantifying these elements allows habitat repair to be effectively targeted toward improving ecosystem function for desirable species. We present a study that incorporates stable isotopes and quantitative sampling to investigate the relative importance of different estuarine areas for juveniles of exploited prawn species within the context of habitat rehabilitation, and the potential drivers of these relationships. Eastern King Prawn (Penaeus [Melicertus] plebejus) and School Prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) were studied for two years in the lower Hunter River estuary, on the temperate east coast of Australia. The higher salinity areas near the lower end of the estuary were most important for Eastern King Prawn, and marsh systems in the lower estuary were only important for the species where there was good connectivity with oceanic water. Areas along the estuary were important for juvenile School Prawn, especially marsh habitats, and relative abundance tended to increase with increasing distance along the estuary. Designation of effective juvenile habitat for School Prawn may have been affected by high fishing mortality in fished areas, but this requires further investigation. Salinity, depth, turbidity and distance along the estuary were all important indicators of prawn distribution. The implications of these patterns for current and future habitat rehabilitation in temperate Australia are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the past 40 years, the fishery in the Mediterranean Sea has seen numerous changes in technology, fleet composition, effort allocation and management strategies. In this paper, our aim is to summarize the improvements, and highlight the flaws and difficulties that have characterised fisheries management in the Mediterranean Sea in the past decades. We (the authors) advocate the importance of the regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in the Mediterranean. We focused on the Adriatic Sea, with two case studies - the fishery for sardine and anchovy, and the fishery for Nephrops. The former is emblematic as it is one of the most valuable and well-studied fisheries in the Mediterranean but it is also an example of a management process that is slowly bearing fruit. Nephrops, on the other hand, has been facing the same destiny as other stocks in the Mediterranean; namely, its peculiar biology, a complex fishery, a poorly tailored data collection and inadequate assessments, have delayed action until very recent times. We use these examples to cover several aspects of Mediterranean fisheries management: i) a historical overview of the development of these fisheries and their management; ii) an overview of the main players involved in the scientific analysis and management process and their current and ideal roles; iii) the flaws of the current stock assessment system; and iv) recent developments and potential solutions to comply with the latest reform of the CFP before 2020. We argue that to align Mediterranean management with the CFP and achieve MSY targets, the lack of coordination and definition of roles between the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, the European Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries and the Joint Research Centre need to be resolved. There is a need for adequate assessment models and data to answer increasingly complex management questions, as well as regular external review of the stock assessment models to assure their quality. Finally, the need for the implementation of a TAC management system as an effective tool for Mediterranean fisheries to achieve sustainability is discussed and advocated.},

	abstract = {Two key measures of economic performance are calculated and analyzed for three important Italian trawl fisheries (Northern Thyrrenian Sea, South of Sicily, Northern Adriatic Sea): the Net Economic Returns (NER), which informs on the economic performance and is considered a proxy of resource rent in fisheries and the Return on Fixed Tangible Assets (ROFTA), which is used as an approximation of the Return on Investment (ROI) and is a key financial and performance indicator for a fisherman in order to take a decision to operate in a fishery. The trend of these indicators over the last decade highlights a poor economic performance that is associated with an overall poor condition of the state of resources. The trend of economic performance indicators is put in relation, on a time-based approach, with the different types of management measures applied over the last decade. We show that trends of fishing effort and economic indicators as well as statistical analysis return a coherent interpretation of the main factors affecting the profitability levels of the selected fleets. The study reveals that management measures impacted negatively on the profitability of the sector in the short run. However, economic indicators inverted the trend in the last 3 years. An increasing biomass trend as well as the improvement in fishing mortality of some few stocks, together with the reduction of input costs could be considered as positive drivers which impacted positively on economic profitability of the fisheries concerned. The study argues that even the technical and fishery management provisions in the Mediterranean Sea may have started to reverse the trend in economic profitability of the analyzed fleets. An additional management effort needs, however, to be developed on an urgent basis in order to ensure the achievement of the management goals defined by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).},

	abstract = {The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to achieve “Good Environmental Status” (GES) in EU marine waters by 2020. This initiative started its first phase of implementation in 2012, when each member state defined the GES and environmental targets in relation to 11 descriptors and related indicators for 2020. In 2013, the EU Commission launched the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which aims to achieve biomass levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for all commercial stocks exploited in EU waters by 2020, as well as contribute to the achievement of GES. These two pieces of legislation are aligned since according to Descriptor 3 (commercial fish and shellfish), the MSFD requires reaching a healthy stock status with fishing mortality (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) compatible with the respective MSY reference limits for all commercial species by 2020. We investigated whether the two policies are effectively aligned in the Mediterranean Sea, an ecosystem where the vast majority of stocks show unsustainable exploitation. For this purpose, we assessed and compared the number and typology of stocks considered by the member states when assessing GES in relation to data on stocks potentially available according to the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) and the proportion of landings they represented. The number of stocks considered by the member states per assessment area was uneven, ranging between 7 and 43, while the share of landings corresponding to the selected stocks ranged from 23\% to 95\%. A lack of coherence between GES definitions among the member states was also revealed, and environmental targets were less ambitious than MSFD and CFP requirements. This could possibly reduce the likelihood of achieving fishery sustainability in the Mediterranean by 2020. These conditions limited the envisaged synergies between the two policies and are discussed in consideration of the recent Commission Decision on criteria and methodological standards for GES.},

	abstract = {In the Adriatic Sea, shifts in benthic community structure have been attributed to multiple stressors, from the effects of climate change to the impacts of commercial fishing. Some fishing practices, such as bottom trawling, have caused a widespread decline in exploited fish stocks. Bottom trawling is also expected to have negative impacts on benthic habitats, usually structured by and hosting a large array of invertebrate species, which provide important ecological services to fish and commercial invertebrate stocks. However, in contrast to commercial species for which long-term time series of the abundance exist, data on these habitat-forming invertebrates are scarce, as they are usually caught as bycatch and discarded. Therefore, there is great uncertainty about their long-term trends, and if these populations are stable or declining. Here we used interview surveys conducted with bottom-trawling fishers of the central Adriatic Sea to gather local ecological knowledge on megabenthos abundance occurring in their fishing domain, as an alternative source of information to conventional fisheries data. We interviewed 44 fishers, from the most important ports of the Marche region of Italy, to understand how megabenthic species have changed in abundance within the area since the 1980s. Specifically, we asked fishers to provide qualitative abundance scores for 18 invertebrate species in five phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Bryozoa, Mollusca and Echinodermata) based on their recollection of these species' presence in bycatch. We stratified responses in homogeneous temporal periods and geographic sectors of the study area, and analyzed their response with mixed effect ordered logistic regression models in order to evaluate spatiotemporal changes in the perceived abundance of each species. Our analysis suggests that the abundance of the sponge Geodia cydonium, the molluscs Pecten jacobaeus, Atrina fragilis Neopycnodonte cochlear and the group of holothurians, have declined. From fishers’ perceptions, only the bryozoan Amathia semiconvoluta has increased. Local ecological knowledge can provide important information on environmental change and can highlight species and ecosystems at risk when conventional scientific data are scarce or absent. This approach can be expanded to other regions of the Adriatic and broader Mediterranean Sea to reconstruct change of this heavily exploited marine region.},

	abstract = {The understanding of fish communities' changes over the past centuries has important implications for conservation policy and marine resource management. However, reconstructing these changes is difficult because information on marine communities before the second half of the 20th century is, in most cases, anecdotal and merely qualitative. Therefore, historical qualitative records and modern quantitative data are not directly comparable, and their integration for long-term analyses is not straightforward. We developed a methodology that allows the coding of qualitative information provided by early naturalists into semi-quantitative information through an intercalibration with landing proportions. This approach allowed us to reconstruct and quantitatively analyze a 200-year-long time series of fish community structure indicators in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Our analysis provides evidence of long-term changes in fish community structure, including the decline of Chondrichthyes, large-sized and late-maturing species. This work highlights the importance of broadening the time-frame through which we look at marine ecosystem changes and provides a methodology to exploit, in a quantitative framework, historical qualitative sources. To the purpose, naturalists' eyewitness accounts proved to be useful for extending the analysis on fish community back in the past, well before the onset of field-based monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {The development of fisheries in the oceans, and other human drivers such as climate warming, have led to changes in species abundance, assemblages, trophic interactions, and ultimately in the functioning of marine food webs. Here, using a trophodynamic approach and global databases of catches and life history traits of marine species, we tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic ecological impacts may have led to changes in the global parameters defining the transfers of biomass within the food web. First, we developed two indicators to assess such changes: the Time Cumulated Indicator (TCI) measuring the residence time of biomass within the food web, and the Efficiency Cumulated Indicator (ECI) quantifying the fraction of secondary production reaching the top of the trophic chain. Then, we assessed, at the large marine ecosystem scale, the worldwide change of these two indicators over the 1950–2010 time-periods. Global trends were identified and cluster analyses were used to characterize the variability of trends between ecosystems. Results showed that the most common pattern over the study period is a global decrease in TCI, while the ECI indicator tends to increase. Thus, changes in species assemblages would induce faster and apparently more efficient biomass transfers in marine food webs. Results also suggested that the main driver of change over that period had been the large increase in fishing pressure. The largest changes occurred in ecosystems where ‘fishing down the marine food web’ are most intensive.},

	abstract = {Human activities have strong impacts on ecosystem functioning through their effect on abiotic factors and on biodiversity. There is also growing evidence that species functional traits link changes in species composition and shifts in ecosystem processes. Hence, it appears to be of utmost importance to quantify modifications in the functional structure of species communities after human disturbance in addition to changes in taxonomic structure. Despite this fact, there is still little consensus on the actual impacts of human-mediated habitat alteration on the components of biodiversity, which include species functional traits. Therefore, we studied changes in taxonomic diversity (richness and evenness), in functional diversity, and in functional specialization of estuarine fish communities facing drastic environmental and habitat alterations. The Terminos Lagoon (Gulf of Mexico) is a tropical estuary of primary concern for its biodiversity, its habitats, and its resource supply, which have been severely impacted by human activities. Fish communities were sampled in four zones of the Terminos Lagoon 18 years apart (1980 and 1998). Two functions performed by fish (food acquisition and locomotion) were studied through the measurement of 16 functional traits. Functional diversity of fish communities was quantified using three independent components: richness, evenness, and divergence. Additionally, we measured the degree of functional specialization in fish communities. We used a null model to compare the functional and the taxonomic structure of fish communities between 1980 and 1998. Among the four largest zones studied, three did not show strong functional changes. In the northern part of the lagoon, we found an increase in fish richness but a significant decrease of functional divergence and functional specialization. We explain this result by a decline of specialized species (i.e., those with particular combinations of traits), while newly occurring species are redundant with those already present. The species that decreased in abundance have functional traits linked to seagrass habitats that regressed consecutively to increasing eutrophication. The paradox found in our study highlights the need for a multifaceted approach in the assessment of biodiversity changes in communities under pressure.},

	abstract = {Aim To develop a standardized, quantitative method for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species on marine ecosystems. Location The methodology is applied in the Mediterranean Sea but is widely applicable. Methods A conservative additive model was developed to account for the Cumulative IMPacts of invasive ALien species (CIMPAL) on marine ecosystems. According to this model, cumulative impact scores are estimated on the basis of the distributions of invasive species and ecosystems, and both the reported magnitude of ecological impacts and the strength of such evidence. In the Mediterranean Sea case study, the magnitude of impact was estimated for every combination of 60 invasive species and 13 habitats, for every 10 × 10 km cell of the basin. Invasive species were ranked based on their contribution to the cumulative impact score across the Mediterranean. Results The CIMPAL index showed strong spatial heterogeneity. Spatial patterns varied depending on the pathway of initial introduction of the invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea. Species introduced by shipping gave the highest impact scores and impacted a much larger area than those introduced by aquaculture and the Suez Canal. Overall, invasive macroalgae had the highest impact among all taxonomic groups. These results represent the current best estimate of the spatial variation in impacts of invasive alien species on ecosystems, in the Mediterranean Sea. Main Conclusions A framework for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species was developed. The application of this framework in the Mediterranean Sea provided a baseline that can be built upon with future improved information. Such analysis allows the identification of hotspots of highly impacted areas, and prioritization of sites, pathways and species for management actions.},

This region has been intensely invaded by Indo-Pacific species. The region is exposed to extreme environmental conditions, is subjected to high rates of climate change and has experienced intense fishing pressure. We test the impacts of a new set of fishing regulations currently being implemented, a continued increase in sea temperatures following IPCC projections, and a continued increase in alien species biomass. We first investigate the impacts of the stressors separately, and then we combine them to evaluate their cumulative effects. Our results show overall potential future benefits of fishing effort reductions, and detrimental impacts of increasing sea temperature and increasing biomass of alien species. Cumulative scenarios suggest that the beneficial effects of fisheries reduction may be dampened by the impact of increasing sea temperature and alien species when acting together. These results illustrate the importance of including stressors other than fisheries, such as climate change and biological invasions, in an ecosystem-based management approach. These results support the need for reducing local and regional stressors, such as fishing and biological invasions, in order to promote resilience to sea warming.},

Quantifying this threat is particularly difficult and complex, especially when evaluating multiple species with different ecological requirements. Here, we examine the semi-enclosed basin of the Mediterranean Sea where the inputs of plastic pollution and its impact on marine diversity are still widely unknown. Eighty-four species from six taxonomic classes were evaluated to assess the risk of ingesting plastic marine debris, integrating inter-specific factors such as plastic exposure rates and life history traits (e.g., motility, habitat, and body size). Species were modelled within a spatial context to identify and estimate their exposure to plastic ingestion across the Mediterranean Sea using literature data, species distribution maps and plastic dispersion models. Our approach identified hotspots for the risk of plastic ingestion across multiple taxa in the Mediterranean Sea, highlighting that coastal species are at higher risk of ingesting plastic in the marine environment than open-sea species. The plastic exposure analysis indicated that species with larger home ranges were more at risk of exposure with increased distances while local species were more likely to be exposed to plastic closer to the centre of their home range location. The approach used in this study can be applied to support management and mitigation efforts throughout the Mediterranean Sea and in other geographic regions to minimize the impact of plastic pollution on marine diversity.},

	abstract = {Oyster populations around the world have seen catastrophic decline which has been largely attributed to overexploitation, disease and pollution. While considerable effort and resources have been implemented into restoring these important environmental engineers, the success of oyster populations is often limited by poor understanding of site-specific dispersal patterns of propagules. Water-borne transport is a key factor controlling or regulating the dispersal of the larval stage of benthic marine invertebrates which have limited mobility. The distribution of the native oyster Ostrea edulis in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, together with their densities and population structure at subtidal and intertidal sites has been documented at irregular intervals between 1997 and 2013. This paper revisits this historical data and considers whether different prevailing environmental conditions can be used to explain the distribution, densities and population structure of O. edulis in Strangford Lough. The approach adopted involved comparing predictive 2D hydrodynamic models coupled with particle tracking to simulate the dispersal of oyster larvae with historical and recent field records of the distribution of both subtidal and intertidal, populations since 1995. Results from the models support the hypothesis that commercial stocks of O. edulis introduced into Strangford Lough in the 1990s resulted in the re-establishment of wild populations of oysters in the Northern Basin which in turn provided a potential source of propagules for subtidal populations. These results highlight that strategic site selection (while inadvertent in the case of the introduced population in 1995) for the re-introduction of important shellfish species can significantly accelerate their recovery and restoration.},

The initial recovery of wild stocks is attributed to the combined effects of spawning commercial O. edulis stocks of and larval retention due to local hydrography. The stock decline between 2003 and 2005 is attributed to unregulated harvesting. Significant differences in abundances between sites over this period may be explained by the exploitation of more-readily accessible sites initially and of less accessible sites later.

An understanding of the links between life histories and responses to exploitation could provide the basis for predicting shifts in community structure by identifying susceptible species and linking life-history tactics with population dynamics. 2. We examined long-term trends in the abundance of species in the North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fish community. Between 1925 \& 1996 changes in species composition led to an increase in mean growth rate, while mean maximum size, age at maturity and size at maturity decreased. The demersal fish community was increasingly heavily fished during this period. 3. Trends in mean life-history characteristics of the community were linked to trends in abundance of component species. An approach based on phylogenetic comparisons was used to examine the differential effects of fishing on individual species with contrasting life histories. 4. Those species that decreased in abundance relative to their nearest relative, matured later at a greater size, grew more slowly towards a greater maximum size and had lower rates of potential population increase. The phylogenetically based analyses demonstrated that trends in community structure could be predicted from the differential responses of related species to fishing. 5. This is the first study to link exploitation responses of an entire community to the life histories of individual species. The results demonstrate that fishing has greater effects on slower growing, larger species with later maturity and lower rates of potential population increase.

	abstract = {This paper describes the catch composition in the rapido trawl fishery and the direct effects on non-target species. All data were collected on commercial fishing vessels so as to reflect commercial rapido-trawling practice. The effects on non-target species were measured using two different damage scales (three- and seven-level scales) depending on the morphology of the taxa. Damage assessment was performed taking into account the whole fishing process by collecting individuals that passed through the cod-end, individuals that were retained in the cod-end and dropped onto the deck and individuals that were collected at the end of the sorting operation just before their return to the sea. Due to differences in the habitat and spatial distribution of target species, discard/commercial ratio was very different among the three different target species fisheries: 1:6 in the queen scallop (Aequipecten opercularis) fishery, 2:1 in the flatfish (Solea spp., Platichthys flesus, Psetta maximus and Scophthalmus rhombus) fishery and 9:1 in the scallop (Pecten jacobaeus) fishery. Damage sustained by non-target species was species-specific and related to the morphology of different organisms. The sorting operation produced similar levels of injury to those of the gear itself: all discarded animals showed higher levels of damage after the sorting than before. Damage to animals that had passed through the cod-end followed the same pattern, and these data could give an estimate of the "unobserved mortality". Our observations indicated a higher impact on non-target species caused by the queen scallop fishery than that caused by the flatfish fishery. This could be due to the total amount of hard-shelled species (in the queen scallop fishery, A. opercularis accounted for 87\% of the total catch biomass) in any given haul, since shells macerated the catch during towing. Discarded animals from the queen scallop fishery showed higher levels of damage than those collected in the flatfish fishery. The rapido trawl fishery seemed to exert a strong selective pressure on the macrobenthic community, being able to modify the epibenthic fauna structure which, in heavily exploited fishing grounds, was dominated by bivalves, gastropods, crabs, starfish and brittlestars.},

	abstract = {The common sole (Solea solea) is one of the most important demersal resources in the northern and central Adriatic Sea (GFCM GSA 17). Landings from this basin make up around 23\% of the overall Mediterranean and Black Sea production. Despite the economic relevance of sole in the Adriatic Sea, and its inherent property of being shared among three countries (i.e. Italy, Slovenia and Croatia), studies on its spatial distribution are scarce and aged. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the spatial distribution and investigate the dynamics of this species in the GSA 17. Samples of common sole were collected in the framework of yearly rapido trawl surveys (SoleMon), during late autumn, from 2005 to 2010, i.e. the spawning season of common sole in the Adriatic. Results highlighted that juveniles are mostly concentrated in shallow water (0–30m depth) along the Italian coast and their spatial distribution persisted along the sampled years. By contrast adults were mainly distributed in the central/eastern part of the basin at depths {\textgreater}30m. As a result of the different spatial distributions, juveniles are exploited exclusively by Italian vessels, especially by beam trawlers (i.e. rapido trawl), while adults are caught by Croatian and Slovenian fishing fleets in their respective national waters and by the Italian fleet operating in international waters. These results, while shedding light on the common sole spatial ecology in the Adriatic, represent crucial information for the setting of international collaboration for a rational spatial-based management of the resource.},

	abstract = {Bottom trawling has widespread impacts on benthic communities and habitats. While the direct impacts of trawl disturbances on benthic communities have been extensively studied, the consequences from long-term chronic disturbances are less well understood. The response of benthic macrofauna to chronic otter-trawl disturbance from a Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster) fishery was investigated along a gradient of fishing intensity over a muddy fishing ground in the northeastern Irish Sea. Chronic otter trawling had a significant, negative effect on benthic infauna abundance, biomass, and species richness. Benthic epifauna abundance and species richness also showed a significant, negative response, while no such effect was evident for epibenthic biomass. Furthermore, chronic trawl disturbance led to clear changes in community composition of benthic infauna and epifauna. The results presented indicate that otter-trawl impacts are cumulative and can lead to profound changes in benthic communities, which may have far-reaching implications for the integrity of marine food webs. Studies investigating the short-term effects of fishing manipulations previously concluded that otter trawling on muddy substrates had only modest effects on the benthic biota. Hence, the results presented by this study highlight that data from experimental studies can not be readily extrapolated to an ecosystem level and that subtle cumulative effects may only become apparent when fishing disturbances are examined over larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this study shows that data on chronic effects of bottom trawling on the benthos will be vital in informing the recently advocated move toward an ecosystem approach in fisheries management. As bottom-trawl fisheries are expanding into ever deeper muddy habitats, the results presented here are an important step toward understanding the global ecosystem effects of bottom trawling.},

	abstract = {We attempted to resolve widely different accounts of the impacts of fish trawls on large attached seabed fauna. We quantified the catch and damage by fish trawls on sponges and used a video camera in the trawl net to observe the effects of fishing gear on sponges. The depth of the 30min trawl tows ranged from 25 to 358m, with an average of 78.3m. Sponges were caught in 85\% of trawl tows (n=108). The mean catch of sponges was 87.2kg for half-an-hour (S.D.=132.9kg). The largest single catch of sponges was 797kg. All catches with more than 100kg of sponge were from waters shallower than 100m. On the basis of our observations, we divided the sponges into two types (lump=broadbase,branched=narrowbase) and three height classes ({\textless}300, 301–500 and {\textgreater}500mm). The size composition of sponges on the seabed, as observed on video, differed significantly from the composition of the catch: 80\% of lump sponges and 100\% of branched sponges less than 300mm passed under the net; 68\% of lump sponges and 80\% of branched sponges between 301 and 500mm in height passed under the net. Fewer than 3\% of the intermediate-sized sponges were broken up as they passed under the net. Sponges larger than 500mm high were impacted the most: only 30\% of lump and 60\% of branched sponges passed under the net. Of the 70\% of lump sponges that passed into the net, at least 20\% were broken into pieces. The branched sponges were either torn off by the footrope (20\%) or were smashed and passed or rolled under the net (20\%). Over 90\% of another major megabenthic group, the gorgonians, passed under the net. Overall, the net removed about 14\% of sponges and 3\% of gorgonians. The impact of commercial trawling on megabenthos is estimated for an average year. Our results provide a mechanism for the two main effects of otter trawling: (1) reduction in megabenthos and especially understanding the effects of trawling on sponges; (2) changes in species composition in trawled areas.},

Analysis of seasonal distribution of Dinophysis species identified D. acuminata and D. sacculus as typical spring species, D. caudata, D. fortii and D. rotundata as summer and late summer species and D. tripos as a winter species. The highest abundances occurred when there were large differences between surface and bottom temperatures and salinities. D. caudata, D. sacculus and D. rotundata showed significant relation with \&\#916; t, while the highest abundances of D. acuta, D. fortii and D. tripos were associated with high \&\#916; s values. Much higher abundances of D. caudata and D. fortii in offshore compared to inshore waters of the Northern Adriatic and significant inverse relation of these species with salinity suggested the possibility of their transport by the Italian river-influenced coastal waters towards the eastern Croatian coast during the summer season and under stratified conditions. Toxicity events occurred more frequently in the more eutrophicated Northern Adriatic than in the Southern Adriatic and mostly succeeded the rainfall periods.

In the water, picocyanobacteria and nanoflagellates predominated, the latter being mainly chlorophytes and prymnesiophytes. Comparisons between the results obtained by the 2 methods of investigation indicated that most of the dinoflagellates are unpigmented and, therefore, heterotrophic. An examination of the gut contents showed that picocyanobacteria were only weakly ingested by the oyster and, thus, nanoflagellates constituted the main food resource. Cryptophytes, although poorly represented in the water, were preferentially ingested. Chlorophytes were inefficiently digested since they were found alive and motile in the faeces of the oyster. The ecological implications of this feeding behaviour are discussed.},

An empirical model was created to describe the spatial distribution of the fluid deformation rate. Nauplii responded with escape jumps at mean fluid deformation rates of 0.6–1.9 s−1. Escape success differed between taxa. T. longicornis was the poorest escaper, while A. tonsa and E. affinis were more efficient and similar to one another. Deformation rates differed in different parts of the flow field, which resulted in differences in escape success between the sectors. Nauplii were caught most often in the sector furthest away from the exhalent siphon, where the deformation rate was the weakest. There the nauplii were unable to detect an escape signal in time to react and flee.},

	abstract = {Intertidal population dynamics are driven by a complex series of processes, including larval supply and the possibility of larval predation by benthic animals such as filter-feeders. We hypothesised that cannibalism by adults could play a major role in the population connectivity of mussel populations by removing larvae as they attempt to settle in the adult habitat. Specifically, we tested hypotheses that consumption of mussel larvae by adults removes a significant proportion of potential settlers and is influenced by both settlement intensity and tidal state (flooding or ebbing). Predation of mussel larvae by adult mussels was investigated on incoming and ebbing tides during four spring tides by analysing the gut contents of adult Perna perna and Mytilus galloprovincialis collected from the low intertidal mussel zone between October 2005 and January 2006. Consumption rates were then compared with estimates of successful settler densities on natural beds. The results showed that mortality of competent mussel larvae through adult ingestion removes up to 77\% a of potential settlers. Rates of larval consumption were highest during months of intense settlement, suggesting that mussels feed opportunistically, filtering a relatively fixed volume of water and removing particles, including larvae, in proportion to their densities in the water. Rates of larviphagy were also higher during receding than incoming tides. We suggest that this is due to changes in larval density or, more probably, in adult filtration efficiency that are related to the state of the tide. Despite significant effects of both tidal state and settlement intensity on rates of larval ingestion, neither had a significant effect on the proportion of potential settlers removed. During settlement more than half of all potential settlers are lost through cannibalism, with potentially serious consequences for population maintenance. The results highlight the paradoxical nature of the evolution of settlement mechanisms in mussels, which must balance the advantages of settlement in habitats favourable to adults against the consumption of larvae by adults.},

	abstract = {While the stock of introduced Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) increased in the Oosterschelde estuary (SW Netherlands), so did the filtration pressure of all bivalve species together. In the same period, stocks of native bivalves declined slightly. The expansion of Pacific oysters in Dutch estuaries might be partially due to better abilities of their larvae to avoid or escape filtration, compared to larvae of native bivalves. In this context, escape and swimming abilities of Pacific oyster larvae and the larvae of the native blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) were compared. Swimming behaviour of C. gigas larvae and larvae of M. edulis was recorded in still water and in a suction current mimicking a bivalve feeding current, in a horizontal and in a vertical plane. Larval swimming behaviour in a suction flow field was reconstructed by subtracting local water movement vectors from the total movement of larvae, yielding movement paths due to larval swimming alone. Swimming speeds and the rate of displacement in vertical direction of C. gigas and M. edulis larvae were related to larval shell length, and to the pitch of up- or downward swimming. Larvae of both species did not show escape reactions in a suction flow field. With increasing shell length, larval swimming speeds of both species increased significantly. Swimming speeds of C. gigas larvae were significantly higher than swimming speeds of M. edulis larvae, resulting in a faster vertical displacement. The ability to migrate to more favourable water layers faster may offer C. gigas an advantage over native bivalves with slower swimming larvae.},

Acartia tonsa and Temora longicornis). Remote detection and escape abilities were quantified in siphon flows. Nauplii respond with distinct escape jumps at species- and stage-specific average fluid deformation rates between 0.5 and 4.2
s-1, and escape with average velocities corresponding to {\textasciitilde}60 to 130 body lengths s-1. Most of the species and stages orient their escape jumps upwards and also away from the flow, and are thus able to assess direction of flow.
Sensitivity to hydrodynamic signals is tightly linked to the general motility pattern. Hydrodynamically conspicuous nauplii that move in a jump-sink pattern are more effective at remotely detecting predators than are continuous swimmers of similar size.
We assessed the effects of different motility strategies in terms of detectability and volume encounter with copepod predators by means of simple hydrodynamic models. While jump-sink type nauplii may be at an advantage over swimmers in interactions with
sinking and attacking ambush predators, models suggest no immediate relative benefit in terms of escaping flows of filtering copepods. We discuss these predictions in relation to copepod feeding rates.},

Turbulence enhanced consumption of all stages of the calanoid copepod A. tonsa by the benthic suspension feeder M. edulis, although with significant ontogenetic differences. Clearance on eggs increased significantly with turbulence; without turbulence, eggs sank to the bottom of the experimental cylinder and became unavailable to the mussels. In general, adult copepods escaped a filtrating mussel better than nauplii and copepodites. Experiments showed that the presence of copepodites and adult copepods reduced mussel clearance rate. The present study documents the interaction between turbulence and mussel predation on copepods and illustrates the potential of benthic suspension feeders in shaping the pelagic food web.},

	abstract = {An ecosystem-based approach to bivalve aquaculture management is a strategy for the integration of aquaculture within the wider ecosystem, including human aspects, in such a way that it promotes sustainable development, equity, and resilience of ecosystems. Given the linkage between social and ecological systems, marine regulators require an ecosystem-based decision framework that structures and integrates the relationships between these systems and facilitates communication of aquaculture–environment interactions and policy-related developments and decisions. The Drivers-Pressures-State Change-Impact-Response (DPSIR) management framework incorporates the connectivity between human and ecological issues and would permit available performance indicators to be identified and organized in a manner that facilitates different regulatory needs. Suitable performance indicators and modeling approaches, which are used to assess DPSIR framework components, are reviewed with a focus on the key environmental issues associated with bivalve farming. Indicator selection criteria are provided to facilitate constraining the number of indicators within the management framework. It is recommended that an ecosystem-based approach for bivalve aquaculture be based on a tiered indicator monitoring system that is structured on the principle that increased environmental risk requires increased monitoring effort. More than 1 threshold for each indicator would permit implementation of predetermined impact prevention and mitigation measures prior to reaching an unacceptable ecological state. We provide an example of a tiered monitoring program that would communicate knowledge to decision-makers on ecosystem State Change and Impact components of the DPSIR framework.},

	abstract = {The response of the Adriatic Sea to bora wind forcing in stratified conditions is analyzed using a baroclinic multilayer model. The model is linearized in the momentum equations and fully nonlinear in the thermodynamic equations. The model was forced with an idealized wind field having horizontal shear and also convergence. The alongshore shear is approximated by a harmonic function of the alongshore distance with an 80-km space scale, and a maximum corresponding to a moderate wind of 3 dyn cm(-2). Idealized initial temperature and salinity vertical profiles similar to an autumn situation are assumed. The model was integrated for five days, presumably a duration of a more persistent bora event. Due to strong shear in the bora wind field the sea level is characterized by a series of highs and lows distributed along the longitudinal axis of the Adriatic. The highest positive sea level departures are observed at the northernmost corner of the Adriatic near Venice associated with the wind setup. The strongest upwelling occurs along the northern portion of the Albanian coast where the bora wind has a nonzero alongshore component. The average current field on the fifth day shows a vertical distribution suggesting Ekman dynamics. The current component perpendicular to the coast in the surface layer is oriented in an offshore direction, which then results in a coastal upwelling, especially along the Albanian coast. The alongshore surface velocity component along that portion of the Adriatic coast is in the direction opposite to that associated with the coastal upwelling. Current reversal takes place at a depth of about 30 m, which coincides with the estimated depth of the surface Ekman layer. The model results thus show that at intermediate depths (below the Ekman layer depth) the bora wind weakens the inflowing branch of the Adriatic residual cyclonic circulation (along the eastern shore) and intensifies the return flow along the western shelf break. Therefore, the bora reduces the Levantine Intermediate Water inflow and probably causes its occasional blocking or even complete current reversals. The period of the geostrophic adjustment is characterized by strong inertial oscillations that die down quickly in the coastal boundary layer and persist for the entire period of simulation outside of it. The mean kinetic energy density is higher at the upwelling than at the downwelling coast of the Adriatic. For illustration of numerical results, a satellite infrared image is presented of one situation in the Adriatic Sea characterized by a strong bora wind forcing.},

	volume = {102},
	abstract = {Background and purpose: Migration of the sardine Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) in the northern Adriatic Sea in relation to hydrographic properties of seawater was described. It was observed that seasonal changes in hydrographic properties of seawater (temperature and salinity) could be  related to  migration pattern of  sardine subpopulation in  the  northern Adriatic Sea. Those changes in properties of marine environment probably have an indirect influence on  sardine northward (trophic) migration, but  a  direct  influence on  southward migration. Due to fact that in the last 25 years were not published any data on this issue, the objective of this paper is to described sardine migrations in the northern Adriatic Sea, at the same time regarding to the changes in its environment. Material and methods: Hydrographic data used in this paper were collected at five stations in the northern Adriatic sea and one situated in Kvarner Bay. Fleet of commercial mid-water trawlers (10 fishing vessels), searching for the highest concentration of fish schools using echo sounder and sonar (with aim to obtain the biggest possible catch), were used to collect information about the position of the bulk of sardine subpopulation in the northern Adriatic for each month. The information about migrations of the sardine were collected directly on board, 4-5 times a month, in the period from 1995 to 1997. Results and conclusions: During the spawning season, sardine searched for areas with the highest temperature and  salinity values as  well  as  stabile environmental conditions. After spawning, sardine migrated toward the most productive feeding areas.

Stomach contents of 1,200 specimens, taken at monthly intervals (January–December 1996), were analyzed. The stomachs contents consisted of five major prey groups: Crustacea (Euphausiacea, Mysidacea, Decapoda), Cephalopoda and Teleostei. Euphausiacea constituted the most important food resource by weight, number and frequency occurrence. Teleosts were the second most important food category, while mysids, decapods and cephalopods were occasional food. There was little seasonal variation in diet. Euphausiids were dominant prey during all seasons, and were especially abundant from spring and autumn. Feeding intensity of horse mackerel varied during the year. The lowest intensity of feeding was recorded in winter (February, March) and early spring (April) during the lower sea temperature as well as at the time of intensive spawning. Feeding activity increased upon spawning period (May and June) and was also higher during summer. Feeding intensity and diet composition changed during the diurnal cycle. The highest feeding intensity was recorded at night and during early morning hours. Euphausiids, mysids and a greater part of teleosts dominated night and morning diet, while decapods and cephalopods were most frequently in the daily and evening diet.},

Anchovy (10 to 130 mm total length) were collected during a 1 wk cruise in October 2002. Feeding activity was mainly diurnal in all the length classes: stomach fullness, calculated for each 10 mm size class, was always higher during the day than at night, with maximal values measured for the 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 mm size classes. All analysed life stages of \textit{E. encrasicolus} had a strictly zooplanktivorous diet based on a few species of copepods. The principal prey of \textit{E. encrasicolus} were small-sized copepods, measuring about 0.2 to 0.3 or 0.5 to 0.6 mm in prosoma length. The copepods \textit{Euterpina acutifrons} and \textit{Oncaea} spp. dominated anchovy diet during the day, both in terms of frequency, number and biomass, in all anchovy size classes. During the night, bivalve larvae were also important dietary items, with \textit{Oncaea} spp. and \textit{E. acutifrons} making up {\textgreater}69\% of total prey number for all anchovy size classes. Within the considered size range, the dimensions of particles does not seem to be a limiting factor in food selection, and no relationship was found between anchovy length and the maximal dimension of ingested prey. Ivlev’s electivity index confirmed that European anchovy was able to select specific food items and preferred small copepods such as \textit{E. acutifrons} and \textit{Oncaea} spp., and bivalve and decapod larvae.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Although conceptually robust, it has proven difficult to find practical measures of niche width that are simple to obtain, yet provide an adequate descriptor of the ecological position of the population examined. 2 Trophic niche has proven more tractable than other niche dimensions. However, indices used as a proxy for trophic niche width often suffer from the following difficulties. Such indices rarely lie along a single scale making comparisons between populations or species difficult; have difficulty in combining dietary prey diversity and evenness in an ecologically meaningful way; and fail to integrate diet over ecological time-scales thus usually only comprise single snapshots of niche width. 3 We propose an alternative novel method for the comparison of trophic niche width: the use of variance of tissue stable isotope ratios, especially those of nitrogen and carbon. 4 This approach is a potentially powerful method of measuring trophic niche width, particularly if combined with conventional approaches, because: it provides a single measure on a continuous axis that is common to all species; it integrates information on only assimilated prey over time; the integration period changes with choice of tissue sampled; and data production is theoretically fast and testing among populations simple. 5 Empirical studies are now required to test the benefits of using isotopic variance as a measure of niche width, and in doing so help refine this approach.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Body size determines rates of respiration and production, energy requirements, mortality rates, patterns of predation and vulnerability to mortality. Body size distributions are often used to describe structure and energy flux in communities and ecosystems. 2 If clear relationships can be established between body size and trophic level in fishes, they may provide a basis for integrating community and ecosystem analyses based on size spectra, food webs and life histories. 3 We investigated relationships between the body sizes (weight and length) of north-east Atlantic fishes and their trophic level. The abundance of 15N, as determined by stable isotope analysis, was used as an index of trophic level. 4 Cross-species and comparative analyses demonstrated that body size was unrelated or weakly related to trophic level. Thus allometric relationships between body size and trophic level could not be used to predict the trophic structure of fish communities. 5 The results of the cross-species analyses contrasted with patterns in the size and trophic structure of entire fish communities. When fish communities were divided into size classes, there were strong positive relationships between size class and trophic level. The slope suggested a mean predator : prey body mass ratio of 80 : 1. 6 Our results suggest that body size does not provide a useful surrogate of trophic level for individual species, but that body size is an excellent predictor of trophic level within the community, providing an empirical basis for integrating community analyses based on models of trophic structure and body size distributions.},

Samples were collected in March 1998, during the spawning period of sardines at the beginning of the upwelling season. Isotopic enrichment across plankton size classes was lower than either enrichment between plankton and sardine or enrichment between sardine and dolphin. This difference may be attributed to the presence of chain-forming phytoplankton in some plankton size classes but also to a large degree of omnivory among zooplankton. Also, there was a size-dependent effect on 15 N enrichment of sardine. Sardines \&lt;18 cm had a variable isotopic enrichment but generally higher than those of larger sardines, revealing omnivorous but mostly zoophagous diets. In contrast, sardines ≥18 cm showed a linear decrease of 15 N enrichment with length, as a consequence of the increase in the efficiency of filter-feeding and in the amount of phytoplankton ingested. According to 15 N enrichment, we concluded that probably there are no more than four trophic levels in the studied ecosystem. Nevertheless, our results revealed that the pelagic food web in this upwelling area is more complex than expected due to the generalized omnivory in all organisms. Furthermore, the obtained relationships between δ 15 N and the size of organisms provide the basis for a quantitative analysis of changes in the trophic structure of this ecosystem.},

Variation in δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N over the course of the seasonal production cycle was significantly greater in smaller animals and declined continuously with increasing body size. The duration and magnitude of a decrease in δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N (as observed in the zooplankton community at the start of the production cycle) was reduced and attenuated in larger animals at higher trophic levels (higher mean δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N), likely reflecting different rates of energy propagation in different food web pathways and the transfer of energy to animals with slower turnover times. Animals ≥16 g wet body mass integrated seasonal variation in δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N of their prey, such that a single annual sampling of animals in size classes ≥16 g was sufficient to determine mean δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N. For zooplankton and smaller infauna, very frequent sampling would be required to estimate mean δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N, and we show that measurements of food web properties such as trophic position and predator-prey size ratios would be biased when based on single samples of these small animals.},

	abstract = {The stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.},

	volume = {198},
	issn = {0304-3800},
	abstract = {The NW Mediterranean has a number of structural features in common with upwelling ecosystems. Therefore, an ecological model representing a NW Mediterranean exploited ecosystem was standardized and compared with four previously standardized models from coastal upwelling ecosystems: the Northern and Southern Humboldt (Chile and Peru upwelling systems) and the Northern and Southern Benguela (Namibia and South Africa upwelling systems). Results from biomasses, flows and trophic levels indicated important differences between ecosystems, mainly caused by differences in primary production, which was smallest in the NW Mediterranean Sea. However, principal component analysis (PCA) of biomasses and flows suggested a similar pattern between the NW Mediterranean and the South African systems due to the inclusion of an important fraction of the continental shelf in both ecological models representing these areas. At the same time, diets of commercial species from the NW Mediterranean were more similar to Benguela than Humboldt species. However, the relatively heavy fishing pressure in the NW Mediterranean ecosystem was highlighted relative to its primary production, and was evident from the large catches and small primary production, largest flows from TL 1 required to sustain the fishery (\%PPR), the low trophic level of the catch (TLc), high exploitation rates (F/Z), largest values in the trophic spectra portraying catch: biomass ratio, the FIB index and the demersal: total catch ration. Comparisons of \%PPR, the trophic level of the community (TLco), the biomass of consumers and F/Z ratios seemed to capture the ecosystem effects of fishing: large in the NW Mediterranean, Namibia and Peru upwelling systems. Small pelagic fish were the most important component of the fisheries in the NW Mediterranean and Peruvian systems. However, the smaller production and biomass ratios from the NW Mediterranean could be an indirect indicator of intense fishing pressure on small pelagic fish, also in line with results from consumption of small pelagic fish by the fishery, F/Z ratios and trophic spectra. Moreover, similarities between the NW Mediterranean and Namibian systems were found, mainly related to the demersal: total catch ratios, the FIB index, the relevance of gelatinous zooplankton in the consumption of production and the importance of pelagic-demersal coupling, in remarkable contrast to the other ecosystems. These similarities should be interpreted in terms of dynamic trajectories that the Namibian system has shown due to the collapse of its pelagic ecosystem, partly due to fishing intensity, and the signs that the NW Mediterranean could follow suit in the future.},

The importance of local adaptations in the trophic ecology of this species was estimated. Sardina pilchardus from the Atlantic Iberian coast and from the north-western Mediterranean Sea have clear differences in the feeding apparatus and diet compositions. Those from the Atlantic Iberian coast have significantly more GRs than S. pilchardus of the same size range in the Mediterranean Sea. While S. pilchardus from the Mediterranean Sea mostly depend on prey ranging between 750–1500 and 3000–4000 µm, corresponding mostly to cladocerans, decapods and copepods, those from the Atlantic depend on smaller prey (50–500 and 1000–1500 µm) that include phytoplankton and copepods, particularly during summer months, and S. pilchardus eggs during the winter. The marked difference between the trophic ecology of S. pilchardus in the two areas studied appears to have originated from different dietary strategies that the two populations have adopted in contrasting feeding environments. These differences are shown to profoundly affect the size and quality of prey consumed, and the effect of cannibalism on the populations.},

The aim of this study was to analyse the trophic ecology of two demersal predator species, black anglerfish (Lophius budegassa) and white anglerfish (L. piscatorius), in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Both species are important in the study area due to their high abundance and economic value, but information about their feeding behaviour is scarce. Here, we described the diet composition and ecological role of these two species, investigating whether trophic segregation exists between them and amongst fish of different sizes. In addition, by using experimental survey data we described the spatial distribution of both species to help us interpret trophic behaviour patterns. We gathered samples of two different sizes (small individuals of a total length {\textless}30 cm and large individuals ≥30 cm) of both species and combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon with isotopic mixing models. Our results revealed that both anglerfish species are opportunistic predators, showing a diet composed mainly of fishes and, to a lesser extent, of crustaceans, with a small proportion of cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves and echinoderms. We found trophic segregation between the two species and the two sizes, indicating that they feed on different prey, in line with differences in their spatial distribution within the study area. This partial partition of food resources could also be explained by the differences in rhythms of activity that were reported in previous studies. In addition, although both species occupied a high position within the food web, our results showed that white anglerfish individuals and the large-sized fish of both species held higher trophic positions. This study demonstrates the usefulness of complementary approaches for trophic studies and confirms that both anglerfish species play an important role as predators in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea food web.},

A clear size-related shift in diet was observed in M. barbatus, with an increase in polychaete and shrimp consumption with size and a decrease in small crustacean consumption. In M. surmuletus, a diet shift was observed only between medium and large individuals. Large M. surmuletus preyed on shrimps, polychaetes, bivalves, ophiurids and amphipods, and ingested prey of lower mean mass than M. barbatus of similar size. Difference in size-related increase in δ15N between the two mullid fish species were related to difference of trophic level of their main prey. Sub-surface deposit-feeding polychaetes, carnivorous polychaetes, shrimps and brachyurans presented higher δ15N values than bivalves, small crustaceans and ophiurids. The lower δ13C values observed in M. barbatus compared to M. surmuletus were related to a higher consumption of sub-surface polychaetes in the former species. Significantly, lower δ13C were recorded in fishes collected off the Rhône River, particularly in spring, suggesting an influence of river inputs as a source of particular organic matter for mullids in this zone after the flooding season. Thus, these closely related sympatric fish species displayed diet divergences that were reflected in their stable isotopic signatures.},

Diurnal bottom trawls were also employed to determine which part of the population performed vertical migration. The size range of the population caught by both nets did not match exactly, since very small individuals ({\textless}5cm TL) were obtained only with the pelagic net, indicating that this part of the population had not present on the bottom. In addition, the 95.5\% of the pelagic captures were obtained during the night, while the maximum catches of the bottom net were obtained at midday, indicating that juvenile hake may display nocturnal vertical migration. Pronounced quantitative and qualitative variations in the diet of M. merluccius were observed between pelagic and bottom trawl samples belonging to the same size range. Differences in the stomach fullness and in the state of digestion of the food between benthic and pelagic individuals were also noticed. These results suggest that feeding represented one of the possible constraint factors controlling the vertical migration of juvenile hake.},

	abstract = {Seasonal study of the diet and food consumption of juvenile hake has been carried out in the Central Mediterranean Sea (Southern Tyrrhenian Sea). Fish were the most important food resource in terms of weight (ca. 70\%). Among the fish, Myctophidae and Sternoptychidae, which are usually distributed deeper than juvenile hake, are most important. During summer, Ceratoscopelus maderensis constituted up to 21\% of weight of all prey, and Maurolicus muelleri represented almost 10\%. During autumn M. muelleri became the most important food resource. The way in which these more deeply distributed prey enter shallower food webs relates to the daily vertical migrations of lanternfish. In upper water column strata at night or near dawn they become prey of the juvenile hake. Considering that trophic energy flows primarily downward, in the direction of the productivity gradient, the observed flow of energy from deep strata into epipelagic layers could be considered an inverse energy transfer. Daily food consumption of juvenile hake ranged between 4.11 and 4.72\% of the body wet-weight (BWW). The application of a square-root model allowed calculation of the fraction of this consumption derived by ingestion of the more deeply distributed mesopelagic fish. Between 11.6\% and 17.8\% of food consumption was sustained by this energy flow. Such information is useful for understanding the interaction between communities distributed in different depth ranges and to reinforce the idea that marine communities are open systems in which migratory movements can dramatically change the assumptions and results of mass-balance models.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the ontogenetic diet change of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) in the north sector of the Strait of Sicily (SoS), central Mediterranean Sea. The species is one of the most important fish predators within the Mediterranean marine ecosystem and one of the main target species for local fisheries. A total of 2669 hake specimens between 7.5 and 67 cm of total length (TL) were collected in 2014–2015. The sample was divided into nine size classes and quantitative feeding indices were calculated for each size-class in order to analyse ontogenetic changes in prey preferences. Hierarchical cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) showed the occurrence of three main hake feeding guilds separated at 50\% similarity. Euphausiids and mysids dominated the diet of hake smaller than 14 cm TL and crustacean decapods and fish were the main prey of hake between 14.5 cm to 17.5 cm TL. A shift toward pelagic and necto-benthic fish occurred over 18 cm TL: hake between 18 and 32 cm TL prey mostly upon Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) whilst the silver scabbardfish (Lepidopus caudatus) was an important prey for hake over 32 cm TL. The study highlighted the key role played by the Atlantic horse mackerel for hake diet in the SoS, which is different to what has been previously observed in other Mediterranean areas where piscivorous hake feed substantially on small pelagic fish, such as anchovy and sardine. Information on hake diet composition, as provided in this study, can be integrated with data on consumption rate and population size to develop multispecies models leading to a quantitative understanding of the role of hake in the ecosystem.},

Samples were taken at 0.5, 10, and 20m, as well as near the bottom, using 5-l Niskin bottles. For inter-annual variation in the density of copepod assemblages data were presented as total number of nauplii and copepodites with adult copepods of the following groups: Calanoida, Cyclopoida-oithonids, Cyclopoida-oncaeids and Harpacticoida. Moreover, hydrographic conditions, both fractions of phytoplankton, non-loricate ciliates and tintinnids were taken into consideration. Nauplii are the most numerous fraction at both stations with an average over 74\% in the total number of all copepod groups. Their numbers were significantly higher at the western eutrophic station, while at the eastern oligotrophic station, an absolute maximum of 693 ind.l−1 was noted. The maximum values of calanoids and oithonids occur generally during summer and these copepods are always more numerous at the western station: 33–50\% and 50–63\%, respectively. The most abundant taxa identified were the calanoid Paracalanus parvus and the cyclopoid Oithona nana. Oncaeid species Oncaea waldemari and Monothula subtilis dominated during late autumn and winter. An atypical increase in the abundance of oncaeids during the summer of 1997 could be related to an invasion and mass occurrence of the calycophoran siphonophore Muggiaea atlantica. It can be concluded that these dominant copepods are responsible for the stabilization of very complex processes. Atypical appearances of major copepod groups and disturbances in the copepod population structure itself can significantly influence changes in the ecosystem of this very sensitive region.},

Of previously known adult euphausiid species – 12 for the Adriatic (Gangai et al., 2012) and 13 for the Mediterranean (Mavidis et al., 2005) – calyptopes of 11 species of euphausiids were recorded.

Species were characterized according to their mean depth: surface (0–50m), sub-surface (50–200m), mesopelagic (200–800m), or bathypelagic (800–1200m) and vertical dispersion (scattered or non-scattered). Four diel patterns emerged: (i) nocturnal ascent to upper layers (Euphausia brevis, E. hemigibba, E. krohnii, Nematoscelis megalops, N. couchii), (ii) migration to upper layers at middle of the day and at night, and descent during the morning and evening (Stylocheiron maximum – only winter), (iii) weakly-migrating or non-migrating (S. longicorne), (iv) irregular migration independent of the day/night cycle (S. abbreviatum, S. maximum – during spring, summer and autumn, T. aequalis).},

In this context, oceanographic data and biological samples were collected in two different surveys, carried out during late June 2011 and early July 2015 in the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea). Differences in abundance, biomass, and assemblage structure of zooplankton and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus Linnaeus, 1758) population were observed between the two surveys. Still, zooplankton biomass was significantly correlated to longitude, chlorophyll a recorded during the surveys (as a proxy of primary production), and oxygen concentrations. Such differences affected the isotopic composition of anchovy, which showed changes in δ15N and δ13C values between the two surveys. Mixing models identified different contributions of food sources in the two sampling periods, i.e., major consumption on large copepods and euphausiids in 2015 with respect to 2011, which was consistent with a greater availability of these preys in the environment in 2015. The obtained results evidenced that E. encrasicolus may be affected by any environmental change that influences the plankton community, which is the basis of the diet of these fishes. Such findings highlighted the importance to further investigate the trophic relationships among different compartments of the food web, as well as the possible environmental influences, in order to obtain a more complete picture of ecosystem functioning and also in the light of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.},

Fluorescently dyed Artemia salina were recovered in the stomach and intestine of lobsters proving that the filtered particles are passed to the digestive tract. Results from other experiments, using the blood pigment (haemocyanin) concentration as an index of nutritional state, indicated that the lobsters can get some nutritional advantage from suspension feeding.

	abstract = {Stable isotope analysis provides a powerful tool to identify the energy sources which fuel consumers, to understand trophic interactions and to infer consumer trophic position (TP), an important concept that describes the ecological role of consumers in food webs. However, current methods for estimating TP using stable isotopes are limited and do not fulfil the complete potential of the isotopic approach. For instance, researchers typically use point estimates for key parameters including trophic discrimination factors and isotopic baselines, and do not explicitly include variance associated with these parameters when calculating TP. We present “tRophicPosition,” an r package incorporating a Bayesian model for the calculation of consumer TP at the population level using stable isotopes, with one or two baselines. It combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations through JAGS and statistical and graphical analyses using R. We model consumer and baseline observations using relevant statistical distributions, allowing them to be treated as random variables. The calculation of TP—a random parameter—for one baseline follows standard equations linking 15N enrichment per trophic level and the trophic position of the baseline (e.g. a primary producer or primary consumer). In the case of two baselines, a simple mixing model incorporating δ13C allows for the differentiation between two distinct sources of nitrogen, thus including heterogeneity derived from alternatives sources of δ15N. Methods currently implemented in “tRophicPosition” include loading, plotting and summarizing stable isotope data either from multiple sites and/or communities or a local assemblage; loading trophic discrimination factors from an internal database or generating them; defining and initializing a Bayesian model of TP; sampling posterior parameters; analysing, comparing and plotting posterior estimates of TP and other parameters; and calculating a parametric (non-Bayesian) TP estimate. Additionally, full documentation including examples, multiple vignettes and code are available for download.},

	abstract = {Use of stable isotope ratios to trace pathways of organic matter among consumers requires knowledge of the isotopic shift between diet and consumer. Variation in trophic shift among consumers can be substantial. For data from the published literature and supplementary original data (excluding fluid-feeding consumers), the mean isotopic shift for C was + 0.5 ± 0.13‰ rather than 0.0‰, as commonly assumed. The shift for C was higher for consumers analyzed as muscle (+ 1.3 ± 0.30‰) than for consumers analyzed whole (+ 0.3 ± 0.14‰). Among consumers analyzed whole, the trophic shift for C was lower for consumers acidified prior to analysis (- 0.2 ± 0.21‰) than for unacidified samples (+ 0.5 ± 0.17‰). For N, trophic shift was lower for consumers raised on invertebrate diets (+ 1.4 ± 0.21‰) than for consumers raised on other high-protein diets (+ 3.3 ± 0.26‰) and was intermediate for consumers raised on plant and algal diets (+ 2.2 ± 0.30‰). The trophic shift for S differed between high-protein (+ 2.0 ± 0.65‰) and low-protein diets (-0.5 ± 0.56‰). Thus, methods of analysis and dietary differences can affect trophic shift for consumers; the utility of stable isotope methods can be improved if this information is incorporated into studies of trophic relationships. Although few studies of stable isotope ratios have considered variation in the trophic shift, such variation is important because small errors in estimates of trophic shift can result in large errors in estimates of the contribution of sources to consumers or in estimates of trophic position.},

Larvae collected during both day and night were analysed, and it was found that feeding incidence was high, regardless of the time of day. Examination of the visual system corroborated the hypothesis that hake larvae should be able to cope with a wide range of photic conditions and to forage even at low light intensity. A clear preference for adult calanoid copepods and, especially, for Clausocalanus spp. was observed in all sizes analysed. Prey number increased with larval size, but prey size did not. This finding indicates that hake larvae behave as selective and specialist predators that consume an increasing number of prey rather than larger prey during larval growth.},

Both of these aspects of trophic behaviour were analysed as function of different biotic and abiotic factors. Prey were grouped by factors such as size, swimming behaviour and energy density. The trophic niche breadth values observed (2.25–2.89) were very similar regardless of the geographic area (geomorphology) and season. The FSs analysed were also quite similar regardless of the geographic area (geomorphology) and season, or predation environment (bottom or water column). Conversely, the FSs were linked with predator size. Increased predator size allowed changes in predatory behaviour through the development of preferences for larger and more energy-rich prey. The changes in FS from generalist to specialist began at a total length (TL) of approximately 12cm in both populations analysed. At larger sizes, the juveniles of both populations became more specialised, as confirmed by the reduction in the breadth of the individual trophic niche. The observed simultaneous changes in the FS, which occurred regardless of the geomorphology and seasonal characteristics, suggest that this shift is driven primarily by endogenous factors. The influence of body size on the foraging behaviour of European hake in the early life stages after bottom recruitment is a crucial information for the application of ecosystem mass-balance models.},

This study focuses on juvenile and adult hake feeding ecology in the Gulf of Lions, using information from scientific surveys carried out during two seasons and three years (2004-2006). Stomach content and stable isotope (δ 15 N, δ 13 C) analyses were performed, and the main factors explaining variations in δ 15 N were investigated using GLMs. In the Gulf of Lions, hake mostly fed on crustaceans and fish and a dominant piscivorous regime was reached at 15 cm total length. Pelagic fish (sardine, anchovy and small blue whiting) were the main source of prey (40\%-80\%) and cannibalism was low ({\textless} 5\%). The results confirmed that hake is an opportunistic feeder and also showed that the size and diversity of prey vary among hake size classes, probably as a result of the different spatial distribution and/or foraging migrations. The present study finally postulates that the unbalanced sex ratio (80\% female against 20\% male) observed at the adult stage could be related to the combination of growth pattern differences, diet and exploitation rate on the continental shelf, where the males spend a longer period of time.},

	abstract = {Abstract European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is one of the most economically important fish for the Mediterranean Sea. It is an important predator of deep upper shelf slope communities currently characterized by growth overexploitation: the understanding of hake's diet might support next generation management tools. However, all current European hake diet studies depend on the morphological identification of prey remains in stomach content, with consequent limitations. In this study, we set up a metabarcoding approach based on cytochrome oxidase I PCR amplification and Miseq Illumina paired-end sequencing of M. merluccius stomach content remains and compared the results to classic morphological analyses. A total of 95 stomach contents of M. merluccius sampled in the North-Central Adriatic Sea were analyzed with both the metabarcoding and morphological approaches. Metabarcoding clearly outperformed the morphological method in the taxonomic identification of prey describing more complex trophic relationships even when considering the morphological identification of 200 stomach contents. Statistical analysis of diet composition revealed a weak differentiation among the hake's size classes, confirming an opportunistic feeding behavior. All the analyses performed showed the presence of a core of shared prey among the size classes and a cloud of size-specific prey. Our study highlights the exceptional potential of metabarcoding as an approach to provide unprecedented taxonomic resolution in the diet of M. merluccius and potentially of other marine predators, due to the broad-spectrum of detection of the primers used. A thorough description of these complex trophic relationships is fundamental for the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries.},

Biological samples of recruits were collected monthly during 2000, 2001 and 2002, and samples of pre-recruits in 2000 and 2002, from the coastal waters of the UK and France. Age in days was determined by statolith analysis. Significant differences in age-at-recruitment were found between the autumnal recruitment, and the rest of the year, and between cohorts. Juvenile growth models were fitted for pre-recruit specimens, and indicated growth rate was significantly higher in 2002 than in 2000. Spatial differences observed were found in 2000, and indicated pre-recruit growth may depend on local environmental conditions.

	abstract = {Age and growth of the horned octopus Eledone cirrhosa are estimated for the first time by stylet increment analysis. Specimens were collected between March 2009 and March 2010 from the commercial trawl fishery operating off northwestern Iberian coasts. A pool of stylets representing all size classes were defined by means of modal progression analysis performed separately for each sex in northern and western fishing grounds over a total of 2220 individuals (306 males and 595 females from the northern fishing ground; and 379 males and 940 females from the western fishing ground). In total, 122 stylets belonging to individuals with a total weight ranging from 67 to 950 g were successfully analysed. Age of the specimens was estimated assuming a daily deposition rate of growth increments within the stylet. Estimated age of the specimens varied from 106 to 516 days. Differential longevity between sexes was observed, with females reaching a life span of 17 months while males attained reached only 14 months, although the possibility that this difference might be even greater is discussed. Based on estimated age, hatching date was back-calculated and it was concluded that hatching occurs throughout the year, with a peak in winter. Relative instantaneous growth rates estimated for 90-day age classes, ranged from 0.03\% to 2.17\% of body weight per day, depending on age. The results obtained are compared with the information available on this species.},

	abstract = {A series of modeling simulations was performed to evaluate the underlying factors and principles that drive the uncertainty in measured bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) and biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) for fish, and to determine which sampling designs minimize those uncertainties. Temporal variability of chemical concentrations in the water column, and the metabolism rate and n-octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) for the chemical were determined to be the dominant factors that influenced the field-sampling design. Spatial variability of the chemical concentrations, food web structure, and the sediment-water column concentration quotient had a lesser importance upon the overall design. The simulations also demonstrated that collection of composite water samples in comparison to grab water samples resulted in reductions in the uncertainties associated with measured BAFs. Some illustrative sampling design structures for BAF and BSAF measurements based upon the temporal variability of chemical concentrations in the water column and the metabolism rate and Kow for the chemical were developed. These illustrative designs provided a sense of how sampling design structures, that is, the number and spacing over time of sampling events, might be influenced by differences in temporal variabilities, metabolism rates, and Kow. Although the importance of spatial variability was discounted as a major factor in the design process, sampling of water and sediment across the immediate home range of the sampled organism is required for successful measurements because poor spatial coordination of organism, water, or sediment samples will yield BAFs and BSAFs with large and unknown biases.},

Extensive opportunities exist to improve the empirical robustness of ecosystem models through the incorporation of biochemical tracer data and derived indices, an area that is rapidly expanding because of advances in analytical developments and sophisticated statistical techniques. Here, we explore the trophic information required by ecosystem model frameworks (species, individual, and size based) and match them to the most commonly used biochemical tracers (bulk tissue and compound-specific stable isotopes, fatty acids, and trace elements). Key quantitative parameters derived from biochemical tracers include estimates of diet composition, niche width, and trophic position. Biochemical tracers also provide powerful insight into the spatial and temporal variability of food web structure and the characterization of dominant basal and microbial food web groups. A major challenge in incorporating biochemical tracer data into ecosystem models is scale and data type mismatches, which can be overcome with greater knowledge exchange and numerical approaches that transform, integrate, and visualize data.},

	abstract = {Coastal marine upwelling famously supports elevated levels of pelagic biological production, but can also subsidize production in inshore habitats via pelagic-benthic coupling. Consumers inhabiting macroalgae-dominated rocky reef habitats are often considered to be members of a food web fuelled by energy derived from benthic primary production; conversely, they may also be subsidized by materials transported from pelagic habitats. Here, we used stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) to examine the relative contribution of pelagic and benthic materials to an ecologically and economically important benthivorous fish assemblage inhabiting subtidal macroalgae-dominated reefs along 1,000 km of the northern Chilean coast where coastal upwelling is active. Fish were isotopically most similar to the pelagic pathway and Bayesian mixing models indicated that production of benthivorous fish was dominated (median 98\%, range 69–99\%) by pelagic-derived C and N. Although the mechanism by which these materials enter the benthic food web remains unknown, our results clearly highlight the importance of pelagic-benthic coupling in the region. The scale of this subsidy has substantial implications for our basic understanding of ecosystem functioning and the management of nearshore habitats in northern Chile and other upwelling zones worldwide.},

However, cross-system comparisons in delta(15)N can be complicated by differences in delta(15)N at the base of the food chain. Such baseline variation in delta(15)N is difficult to resolve using plankton because of the large temporal variability in the delta(15)N of small organisms that have fast nitrogen turnover. Comparisons using large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of their slower nitrogen turnover, show that delta(15)N increases markedly with the human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in delta(15)N likely reflects the high delta(15)N of human sewage. Correcting for this baseline variation in delta(15)N, we report that, contrary to expectations based on previous food-web analysis, the food chains leading up to fish varied by about only one trophic level among the 40 lakes studied. Our results also suggest that the delta(15)N signatures of nitrogen at the base of the food chain will provide a useful tool in the assessment of anthropogenic nutrient inputs.},

They encompass empirical and numerical approaches with focus ranging from molecules to ecosystems. We further examine the relationship of each method to features such as the scale of observation (from microbes to largest organisms) and organisational level (from individuals to ecosystems) as well as the ecological question the method is capable of answering (from detecting predator-prey relationships to studying implications and consequences at different scales). Our survey reveals a very wide range of methodologies, each more-or-less appropriate for a particular line of research. It also identifies deficits, for example, trophic interactions at microscopic scales, for which empirical methods have hardly been used, as well as trophic models that have failed to consider fluxes at the ecosystem scale. Furthermore, we note that the combination of methodologies remains under-exploited despite great opportunities to solve complex ecological questions and to foster the emergence of new insights and hypotheses regarding organism, population and/or ecosystem properties.},

In recent years, there has been considerable development in both the methodology and application of novel and more traditional dietary tracing methods, yet there is no comprehensive synthesis that systematically and quantitatively compares the different approaches. Here we conceptualise diet tracing in ecology, provide recommendations for method selection, and illustrate the advantages of method integration. We summarise empirical evidence on how different methods quantify diet mixtures, by contrasting estimates of dietary proportions from multiple methods applied to the same consumer-resource datasets, or from experimental studies with known diet compositions. Our data synthesis revealed an urgent need for more experiential comparisons among the dietary methods. The comparison of diet quantifications from field observations showed that different techniques aligned well in cases with less than six diet items, but diverged considerably when applied to more complex diet mixtures. Efforts are ongoing to further advance dietary estimation, including how reliably compound specific stable isotope analyses and fatty acid profiles can quantify more prey items than bulk stable isotope analyses. Similarly, DNA analyses, which can depict trophic interactions at a higher resolution than any other method, are generating new ways to better quantify diets and differentiate among life-stages of prey. Such efforts, combined with more empirical testing of each dietary method and establishment of open data repositories for dietary data, promise to greatly advance community and ecosystem ecology.},

Carbon and nitrogen isotope data were entered into a mixing model containing 5 potential production sources. Results were inconclusive due to overlapping isotopic signatures of certain sources, but nonetheless indicated that most fishes and macroinvertebrates assimilated material derived mostly from variable mixtures of macrophytes and filamentous algae. Highest estimates of percentage of material assimilated directly or indirectly from C4 marsh grasses (ranging from 30 to 82\%) were for spot Leiostomus xanthurus and Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis. Isotopic analysis could not reveal the detailed structure of predator–prey interactions at the species level; greater detail of trophic pathways was revealed by the dietary analysis. Estimates of vertical web structure (species trophic levels) by the 2 methods were largely concordant. The exceptions were 2 zooplanktivorous and detritivorous fish species and grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio that had higher trophic levels according to nitrogen isotope ratios. For these taxa, the isotopic method more accurately indexed the number of trophic transfers than the dietary method, which depends on accurate dietary estimation for all food chain components leading to a consumer, and which assumes equal assimilation efficiencies for items found in stomach contents. The isotopic method underestimated trophic levels of several invertebrates, possibly due to inaccurate estimation of mean δ15N for production sources supporting these taxa and/or differential trophic fractionation. Together, stable isotope and dietary analyses provide a more accurate assessment of food web structure and dynamics of coastal marsh ecosystems than either method alone.},

	abstract = {Temporal variations in feeding habits and trophic levels of 3 deep-sea fishes: Hoplostethus mediterraneus, Hymenocephalus italicus and Nezumia aequalis, were investigated off the Archipelago of Cabrera (Algerian Basin). These species are representative of the 3 main trophic guilds found at bathyal depths: plankton feeders, suprabenthos feeders and epi-endobenthos feeders. Samples were collected during 6 trawl surveys at bi-monthly intervals from August 2003 to June 2004, between 550 and 750 m depths. Stomach content and stable isotope analyses were performed to detect temporal variations in diet. Because fish were immediately fixed in 10\% formalin, a parallel experiment comparing isotope composition in fixed and freshly frozen tissues was carried out. H. mediterraneus mainly preyed on isopods throughout the sampling period and to a lesser extent on amphipods and mysids, although mixing models revealed high consumption of mesopelagic fish in winter and spring. H. italicus fed on mysids and amphipods that live in the benthic boundary layer, while N. aequalis exhibited a more benthic diet composed of benthopelagic and benthic prey (e.g. tanaids and polychaetes). Temporal variation was observed in the diet of H. mediterraneus, with February being the period of change in feeding habits. Temporal changes were also evident, though weaker than in H. mediterraneus, in the diets of the 2 macrourids, H. italicus and N. aequalis. Patterns of temporal change in fish diets follow temporal variations in prey, which are stronger in mesopelagic than in suprabenthic or benthic fauna. Temporal variations in tissue δ15N were detected in the 3 species, with the lowest values occurring in September and the highest in April to June. In general, different time lags were detected between the isotopic turnover time of consumers and that of their diets (prey) at a monthly time scale, showing that assimilation times depend on species behaviour and metabolism. Assimilation times are brief in H. mediterraneus but last up to 2 mo in the benthic feeder N. aequalis. The experiment comparing fixed versus frozen tissues showed that formalin did not affect δ15N values after 6, 12 and 24 mo of preservation, while δ13C signatures were depleted to different extents in the 3 species compared with controls.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystem models that incorporate fisheries and climate change are essential for forecasting and guiding sustainable ecosystem management decisions. A key challenge in developing and applying ecosystem models that are able to provide robust predictions for management is to accurately represent the structure and dynamics of food webs. Ecosystem models vary in complexity and formulation and there is no set method routinely used to evaluate the skill of a model to correctly represent food web characteristics. One approach for evaluation is the comparison of modelled food web attributes with measures of stable isotope composition of taxa. While this approach has been used in some studies, its full potential has not been realised. Critically, directly modelling the assumed underlying processes that give rise to stable isotope signatures in ecosystem models has only just begun to be explored. Here, we examine the process of building ecosystem models and assess the potential for incorporating stable isotope results into this process, including the evaluation of model skill. We consider both size- and species- based ecosystem modelling approaches for their potential in this regard. We discuss that whilst conceptually achievable, in practice this is highly challenging through highlighting the advances and challenges in using stable isotope data, including the implications of precision associated with isotope-based measurements. We conclude with a proposed framework for explicitly integrating stable isotope data into both size- and species- based ecosystem models as an example of how signatures may be more powerfully used in the modelling process, and highlight key needs for future work.},

Nitrogen stable isotope data have been used to estimate intra- and inter-specific variation in trophic level, predator-prey size ratios, transfer efficiency, food chain length, relationships between predator and prey species diversity and the dynamics of energy use. Many of these estimates have contributed to the development, testing and parameterisation of food web and ecosystem models, some of which have been used to establish baselines for assessing the scale of human impacts. The interpretation of results depends on assumed fractionation but, when supported by sensitivity analyses and experimental validation, nitrogen stable isotope data provide valuable insights into the structuring of marine communities and ecosystems.

	abstract = {In aquatic systems, predators are usually larger in body size than their prey, and within a species larger individuals tend to occupy higher trophic levels. This has led to the expectation that communities are strongly size-structured. In the present study, we tested whether size structuring was present in a demersal trawl assemblage from the Western Arabian Sea. Nitrogen and carbon stable
isotopes were used to describe trophic level and basal resource utilisation and were assessed against body size (log2 size class) at both the community (species independent) and species levels. Nitrogen and bulk carbon isotopic values were significantly and positively related to body mass at the community level. Despite sampling over 15 log2 mass classes (0.001 to 32.8 kg), the trawl assemblage spanned approximately 1 trophic level. The community relationship between δ13C and log2 body mass was associated with higher lipid content in smaller size classes. In contrast, comparisons of the δ15N and δ13C
values of species at a similar stage of their life history (55 to 80\% of maximum length) were independent of body size, suggesting reduced niche overlap at different sizes. While some small species feed at high trophic levels and vice versa, they contributed comparatively little to the sampled community biomass, and overall, the community was size-structured in terms of trophic level.},

	abstract = {The study of the feeding ecology of marine organisms is crucial to understanding their ecological roles and advancing our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning. The aim of this study was to analyse the trophic ecology of two demersal predator species, black anglerfish (Lophius budegassa) and white anglerfish (L. piscatorius), in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Both species are important in the study area due to their high abundance and economic value, but information about their feeding behaviour is scarce. Here, we described the diet composition and ecological role of these two species, investigating whether trophic segregation exists between them and amongst fish of different sizes. In addition, by using experimental survey data we described the spatial distribution of both species to help us interpret trophic behaviour patterns. We gathered samples of two different sizes (small individuals of a total length {\textless}30 cm and large individuals ≥30 cm) of both species and combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon with isotopic mixing models. Our results revealed that both anglerfish species are opportunistic predators, showing a diet composed mainly of fishes and, to a lesser extent, of crustaceans, with a small proportion of cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves and echinoderms. We found trophic segregation between the two species and the two sizes, indicating that they feed on different prey, in line with differences in their spatial distribution within the study area. This partial partition of food resources could also be explained by the differences in rhythms of activity that were reported in previous studies. In addition, although both species occupied a high position within the food web, our results showed that white anglerfish individuals and the large-sized fish of both species held higher trophic positions. This study demonstrates the usefulness of complementary approaches for trophic studies and confirms that both anglerfish species play an important role as predators in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea food web.},

	abstract = {Background. The red mullet, Mullus barbatus L., is abundantly captured and targeted throughout the year in Tunisian waters but not all aspects of its biology have been studied well. One of them—the feeding behaviour of this fish may be important for stock assessment, ecosystem modelling, and understanding mechanism and processes which structure and influence the fish assemblages. The aim of this paper is to describe the diet of specimens from the northern coast of Tunisia, to analyse seasonal variations in its composition and to delineate feeding intensity in relation to sex and size. Materials and methods. Red mullet were sampled from different landing sites along the northern Tunisian coast and the Gulf of Tunis. Random samples were taken from both commercial and demersal trawlers from January to December 2005. A total of 472 specimens were examined following the commonly accepted procedures. The following parameters were analysed: vacuity index, percentage frequency of occurrence, percentage numerical abundance, percentage gravimetric composition, and index of relative importance. The trophic level for any consumer species was calculated, for total sample, but also in related to size, sex, and season.
Results. Mullus barbatus mainly fed on crustaceans and polychaetes. According to the classification of fishes in functional groups based on their TROPH red mullet is an omnivorous feeder, animal species being preferential preys. Basing on data assembled by Stergiou and Karpouzi for the Mediterranean ichthyofauna, the estimated trophic levels for the red mullet ranged between 2.79 and 3.57 units. Such within-species differences in trophic levels might reflect the combined effect of the following factors: area, year, length structure, and differential fishing pressure between years and/or areas, because fishing removes the largest individuals of a species, which generally have higher trophic levels.
Conclusion. The red mullet is not only omnivorous, but also opportunistic feeder with trophic level related to body size, season, geographic area and fishing pressure.},

	abstract = {The diet of the red mullet Mullus barbatus was studied in the southeast Black Sea region of Turkey during the autumn, winter, summer and spring. In one year, the stomach contents of 760 individuals of M. barbatus, a confirmed omnivorous fish species, were examined (April 2017 March 2018), in addition to those of 180 additional individuals examined within a 24-h period (28 April 2018). Among the 14 prey groups identified in the stomachs of red mullet, the predominant one was Bivalvia, followed by Nematoda, Polychaeta, Brachyura and Cumacea. Data analysis revealed significant differences in prey species composition between seasons (ANOSIM, R = 0.089, p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, the prey groups that constituted the majority of the diet changed significantly with a season. SIMPER analysis revealed that the prey item contributing the most to the differences between seasons was Bivalvia, Microplastic was also found in the samples. Analysis of the daily rhythm diet variation in stomach contents allowed the identification of 8 prey groups, namely Bivalvia, Amphipoda and Cumacea. In 24 -hour examinations, feeding began in the first hours of the day, then showed an increase in the following hours and decreased after the evening. The results of this study could be used to describe the diversity of prey species and intraspecific food competition in the Black Sea.},

Through the study of mesocosms harboring a diverse benthic coastal community, we reveal that food web architecture can be inflexible under ocean warming and acidification and unable to compensate for the decline or proliferation of taxa. Key stabilizing processes, including functional redundancy, trophic compensation, and species substitution, were largely absent under future climate conditions. A trophic pyramid emerged in which biomass expanded at the base and top but contracted in the center. This structure may characterize a transitionary state before collapse into shortened, bottom- heavy food webs that characterize ecosystems subject to persistent abiotic stress. We show that where food web architecture lacks adjustability, the adaptive capacity of ecosystems to global change is weak and ecosystem degradation likely.},

This was investigated using δ13C and δ15N isotopic signatures in tissues with long and short turnover rates to provide diet discrimination and compare this between males and females. Secondary objectives examined size-related differences and calculated the trophic position based on the new results. Almost half the diet (47\%) was made up of suspended particulate organic matter (POMsusp) alone. Fish was another important item in the diet, with plankton and invertebrate sources coming much lower down in dietary importance. Significantly more suspension feeding was observed in small or medium sized individuals than large ones in both sexes. However, there were no sex-related patterns, despite females being restricted to burrows for part of the analysis period. Female diet was almost identical to males and POMsusp comprised a large component of the diet in both sexes. The trophic position was estimated at 2.94 ± 0.16 (mean ± SD), which was at the lower end of the range reported in previous studies (2.60 to 4.32).},

	abstract = {In 1962, a series of in situ primary production measurements began in the Adriatic Sea, at a station near the island of Vis. To this day, over 55 years of monthly measurements through the photic zone have been accumulated, including close to 3000 production measurements at different depths. The measurements are conducted over a six-hour period around noon, and the average production rate extrapolated linearly over day length to calculate daily production. Here, a non-linear primary production model is used to correct these estimates for potential overestimation of daily production due to linear extrapolation. The assimilation numbers are recovered from the measured production profiles and subsequently used to model production at depth. Using the recovered parameters, the model explained 87\% of variability in measured normalized production at depth. The model is then used to calculate daily production at depth, and it is observed to give on average 20\% lower daily production at depth than the estimates based on linear extrapolation. Subsequently, water column production is calculated, and here, the model predicted on average 26\% lower water column production. With the recovered parameters and the known magnitude of the overestimation, the time-series of water column production is then re-established with the non-linearly-corrected data. During this 55-year period, distinct regimes were observed, which were classified with a regime shift detection method. It is then demonstrated how the recovered parameters can be used in a remote sensing application. A seasonal cycle of the recovered assimilation number is constructed along with the seasonal cycle of remotely-sensed chlorophyll. The two are then used to model the seasonal cycle of water column production. An upper and a lower bound on the seasonal cycle of water column production based on remotely-sensed chlorophyll data are then presented. Measured water column production was found to be well within the range of remotely-sensed estimates. With this work, the utility of in situ measurements as a means of providing information on the assimilation number is presented and its application as a reference for remote sensing models highlighted.},

As such, it is subject to impacts from a large number of human activities, including fishing. In a basin characterized by high biodiversity and complex ecosystem processes, such as the Adriatic Sea, habitat conservation and protection measures rely on detailed information on the composition and structure of benthic assemblages. The present study describes the composition, spatial distribution and persistence of invertebrate megazoobenthic assemblages in the Adriatic Sea. Samples were collected during rapido trawl surveys performed from 2007 to 2012. A total of 4 main megazoobenthic assemblages were identified and were designated as A, B, C and D. Group A assemblages were detected in the northern and central offshore area, Group B assemblages occupied the northernmost part of the basin, Group C assemblages were predominantly found along the western coast and Group D assemblages were detected in the deepest parts of the northern and central basin. A degree of spatial overlap in the northern Adriatic was probably due to the physical and chemical characteristics of the area, which is characterized by strong river runoff, hence by changes in sediment composition from sandy mud to muddy sand. The present findings may help to devise integrated management strategies of fishing activities, especially trawling, in view of the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management, and may help to define some descriptors of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

	abstract = {In Mediterranean European countries, 85\% of the assessed stocks are currently overfished compared to a maximum sustainable yield reference value (MSY) while populations of many commercial species are characterized by truncated size- and age-structures. Rebuilding the size- and age-structure of exploited populations is a management objective that combines single species targets such as MSY with specific goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF), preserving community size-structure and the ecological role of different species. Here, we show that under the current fishing regime, stock productivity and fleet profitability are generally impaired by a combination of high fishing mortality and inadequate selectivity patterns. For most of the stocks analysed, a simple reduction in the current fishing mortality (Fcur) towards an MSY reference value (FMSY), without any change in the fishing selectivity, will allow neither stock biomass nor fisheries yield and revenue to be maximized. On the contrary, management targets can be achieved only through a radical change in fisheries selectivity. Shifting the size of first capture towards the size at which fish cohorts achieve their maximum biomass, the so-called optimal length, would produce on average between two and three times higher economic yields and much higher biomass at sea for the exploited stocks. Moreover, it would contribute to restore marine ecosystem structure and resilience to enhance ecosystem services such as reservoirs of biodiversity and functioning food webs.},

	abstract = {The northern and central Adriatic Sea represents an important spawning and aggregation area for common sole (Solea solea) and provides for around 20\% of the Mediterranean landings. In this area, this resource is mainly exploited with rapido trawl and set nets. The stock is not yet depleted and faces a situation of growth overfishing. The comparison between the spatial distribution by age of S. solea and the geographic patterns of the rapido trawl fishing effort evidenced an overlapping of this fishing activity with the area where juveniles concentrate (age groups 0–2). The majority of spawners inhabits specific offshore areas, here defined as ‘sole sanctuaries’, where high concentrations of debris and benthic communities make difficult trawling with rapido. The aim of this study was to evaluate existing spatial management regimes and potential new spatial and temporal closures in the northern and central Adriatic Sea using a simple modelling tool. Two spatial simulations were carried out in order to verify the effectiveness of complementary methods for the management of fisheries: the ban of rapido trawling from October to December within 6nautical miles and 9nautical miles of the Italian coast. The focus of the simulation is that the effort of the rapido trawl is moved far from the coast during key sole recruitment periods, when the juveniles are moving from the inshore nursery area toward the offshore feeding grounds. The management scenarios showed that a change in selectivity would lead to a clear increase in the spawning stock biomass and an increase in landings of S. solea in the medium-term. The rapido trawl activity could be managed by using a different logic, bearing in mind that catches and incomes would increase with small changes in the spatial pattern of the fishing effort. The present study highlights the importance of taking into account spatial dimensions of fishing fleets and the possible interactions that can occur between fleets and target species, facilitating the development of control measures to achieve a healthy balance between stock exploitation and socio-economic factors.},

	abstract = {The common sole (Solea solea) is one of the most important demersal resources in the northern and central Adriatic Sea (GFCM GSA 17). Landings from this basin make up around 23\% of the overall Mediterranean and Black Sea production. Despite the economic relevance of sole in the Adriatic Sea, and its inherent property of being shared among three countries (i.e. Italy, Slovenia and Croatia), studies on its spatial distribution are scarce and aged. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the spatial distribution and investigate the dynamics of this species in the GSA 17. Samples of common sole were collected in the framework of yearly rapido trawl surveys (SoleMon), during late autumn, from 2005 to 2010, i.e. the spawning season of common sole in the Adriatic. Results highlighted that juveniles are mostly concentrated in shallow water (0–30m depth) along the Italian coast and their spatial distribution persisted along the sampled years. By contrast adults were mainly distributed in the central/eastern part of the basin at depths {\textgreater}30m. As a result of the different spatial distributions, juveniles are exploited exclusively by Italian vessels, especially by beam trawlers (i.e. rapido trawl), while adults are caught by Croatian and Slovenian fishing fleets in their respective national waters and by the Italian fleet operating in international waters. These results, while shedding light on the common sole spatial ecology in the Adriatic, represent crucial information for the setting of international collaboration for a rational spatial-based management of the resource.},

This paper shows that both strategies can be combined in a cognitive architecture that was developed to model other task domains. Variations on the exemplar-based random walk (EBRW) model of Nosofsky and Palmeri (1997b) and the rule-plus-exception (RULEX) rule-based model of Nosofsky, Palmeri, and McKinley (1994) were implemented in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The architecture allows the two strategies to be mixed to produce classification behavior. The combined system reproduces latency, learning, and generalization data from three category-learning experiments - Nosofsky and Palmeri (199Tb), Nosofsky et al., and Erickson and Kruschke (1998). It is concluded that EBRW and ACT-R have different but equivalent means of incorporating similarity and practice. In addition, ACT-R brings a theory of strategy selection that enables the exemplar and the rule-based strategies to be mixed.},

However, the interpretation of δ13C and δ15N is complicated by the influence of multiple factors such as the tissue-specific lipid content. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of lipid extraction on δ13C and δ15N compositions in muscle, hepatopancreas and gonads of a marine decapod crustacean, the spider crab Maja brachydactyla. Samples were analyzed for stable isotopes before and after lipid removal, using a derived Soxhlet extraction method. Differences in δ13C and δ15N were measured among tissues before and after treatment. Lipid extraction of muscle did not have a significant effect on either δ13C or δ15N. By contrast, ecologically significant shifts for both carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes ratios (+2.9±0.8‰ for δ13C, and +1.2±0.7‰ for δ15N) were noticed in the hepatopancreas. In regard to gonads, lipid extraction led to a shift only on δ13C (+1.3±0.3‰). Finally, the derived Soxhlet extraction method removed the lipid influence for δ13C, and had an effect on δ15N composition for lipid-rich samples. We recommend this treatment for carbon stable isotope studies on decapod crustacean lipid-rich tissues.},

	abstract = {1 Stable isotope analyses coupled with mixing models are being used increasingly to evaluate ecological management issues and questions. Such applications of stable isotope analyses often require simultaneous carbon and nitrogen analyses from the same sample. Correction of the carbon isotope values to take account of the varying content of 13C-depleted lipids is then frequently achieved by a lipid-normalization procedure using a model describing the relationship between change in δ13C following lipid removal and the original C:N ratio of a sample. 2 We evaluated the applicability of two widely used normalization models using empirical data for muscle tissue from a wide range of fish and for aquatic invertebrates. Neither normalization model proved satisfactory, and we present some modifications that greatly improve the fit of one of the models to the fish muscle data. For invertebrates we found no clear relationship between change in δ13C following lipid removal and the original C:N ratio. 3 We also examined the effect of lipid-normalization on the output of a mixing model designed to calculate the proportional contribution of prey items to the diet of a consumer. Mixing model output was greatly influenced by whether prey or consumer values alone or together were lipid-normalized and we urge caution in the interpretation of results from these models pending further experimental evidence. 4 Synthesis and applications. We describe a revised lipid-normalization model that should be applicable to a wide range of marine and freshwater fish species in studies applying stable isotope analyses to ecological management issues. However, we strongly advise against applying these kinds of lipid-normalization models to aquatic invertebrate data. The interpretation of outputs from mixing models is greatly influenced by whether the carbon isotope data have been lipid-normalized or not.},

Here we used stable isotope analyses to investigate trophic interactions in the pelagic ecosystem of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea during 2012 and 2013. Our results suggest that European sardine, Sardina pilchardus, and anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, are consumers located at relatively low levels of the pelagic food web. Unexpectedly, the round sardinella, Sardinella aurita, appeared to be located at a higher trophic level than the other small pelagic fish species, although previous studies found similarity in their diets. Isotope data suggested that trophic niches of species within the genera Trachurus spp. and Scomber spp., were distinct. Atlantic bonito Sarda sarda, European hake Merluccius merluccius and European squid Loligo vulgaris, appeared to feed at higher trophic levels than other species. Despite some intraspecific seasonal variability for some species, community trophic structure appeared relatively stable through the year. These data provide an important step for developing models of food web dynamics in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea.},
